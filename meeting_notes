* use one or two psychometric functions for illustration purposes.
* icons for axis labels for displacement
* Optional icon for response CW and CCW.

* Back to differfent size data points for example data

* Be consistent about terminoligy for carrier motion
  * change direction content to "carrier strength" (check every mention)

In talk:
   * Move demo upward (before ?)
   * Talk in terms of "steeper" versus 
   * Crowding slide
     * crowding slide -use two spacings.
   * hunt around for fits that look good.
   * Annotate with icons for data.
   * Show for a single subject. Animate adding for subject 2. (don't
     give subjects two things at once.
   * "the curves are fits of a model of hte entire dataset; the model
     does not fitI will give you details on the model fit

   * Consider "effect of spacing on sensitivity to envelope motion"
     * spacing decreases sensitivity to envelope motion
     * spacing increases sensitivity to envelope motion

     * Fold the envelope motion, Choose 0.1 and 0.4 content to compare.
     * Make it much more obvious that the spacing differs. Big text
       label or icon.
     * The point you make should be in the order of reading.
     * Use the icon....

     * Highlight an example of the subject answering right to totally
       leftward motion.

       * these three points to a description of a model.

       * Show two subjects

    * Fold the wobble graph....

    * Today, Ione like everything to be folded.

    * Ione also wants everything to be colormap plots.
    
    * focus in image scale and/or 3d and/or surface plots
    
    *tentative meeting Apr 9, 10 AM PST

    * schedule somewhere from the 25th to June 15th, ask if people are
      out of town.

    * Week of June 10 is good for Mike. or week of May 20th.
