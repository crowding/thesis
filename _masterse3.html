<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >The time course of a trial is illustrated in <a 
href="#x4-60022">3.2</a>B. A fixation point was presented. The computer then
waited for the observer to fixate. <span 
class="cmr-12">450ms </span>after detecting fixation, the motion stimulus was shown for
400 ms (the initial pulse, then 4 steps of envelope displacement occurring at 100ms intervals.) After
the motion stimulus concluded, the observer indicated the direction of perceived motion by
turning the knob within a response window from <span 
class="cmr-12">400 </span>to <span 
class="cmr-12">950ms </span>measured from stimulus
onset. If the observer blinked or broke fixation before the offset of the motion stimulus,
the trial was aborted and reshuffled into the stimulus set, to be repeated later in the
session. If the response was outside the window, the observer received visual feedback
that their response was either too fast or too slow, and the trial was also reshuffled
into the stimulus set. An audio click was played each time observers gave a response;
this seemed to help observers establish a consistent rhythm through the experiment.
No feedback was given as to the correctness of an observer&#8217;s response, only whether
they had responded within the time window. Observers were instructed to report the
apparent direction of motion, and advised that there were no &#8220;correct&#8221; answers. In some
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
conditions observers reported seeing conflicting or overlapping directions of motion. In
those cases they were advised to choose whichever direction of motion appeared more
salient.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   Observers performed the task in sessions that lasted a maximum of 1 hour, divided into 4 to 6
blocks, and were prompted to take a break between blocks. They could also rest at any time by
simply delaying fixation. At the beginning of each block, the eye tracking system was automatically
recalibrated by asking the observer to make saccades to a sequence of targets at randomly chosen
locations on the screen.

these graphs we scale the area of the data points to be proportionate to the number
of trials collected at that displacement. Thus, the smaller a data point, the further it
may acceptably lie from the model fit; some data drawn using the smallest dots may
represent a single trial at a value of displacement that the staircase procedure did not
revisit.

<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >When staircase procedures were used, they employed randomized folding; a staircase configured to
use a carrier strength <span

counterclockwise (-0.2) carrier on each trial, with the staircase-controlled envelope motion
reversing direction accordingly.
<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   I similarly presume that an observer&#8217;s responses to a stimulus and its mirror image are
symmetric up to a constant bias. Therefore we will present and write about stimuli, without loss of
generality, as though the carrier motion runs clockwise in all trials, even though the underlying
data contains a balanced mixture of clockwise and counterclockwise trials. The mirror image of a
trial reverses the sign of three properties: the carrier motion, the envelope motion, and the
observer&#8217;s response. So, a trial with carrier strength <span

class="cmr-12">1</span>, where the observer responded
&#8220;counterclockwise.&#8221; I use the convention that carrier strength is always shown as positive.
Note that the direction of envelope motion can differ from that of carrier strength,
so that envelope motion will still take both positive and negative values when data is
folded.
<!--l. 227--><p class="indent" >   In some cases observers exhibit a bias toward clockwise or counterclockwise responses. I include
a global bias term in our model to account for this - this is the only term in the model that is not
symmetric. I fit the model using unfolded data. When drawing fitted curves to illustrate model
predictions, I sum out the bias by averaging the model predictions for clockwise and
counterclockwise conditions.
