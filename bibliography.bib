	Abstract = {Perceptual illusions are usually thought to arise from the way sensory signals are encoded by the brain, and indeed are often used to infer the mechanisms of sensory encoding. But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information, reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary, and observers seem to use signals from these 'displaced' neurons to optimize their performance. We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers' perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies, the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded.},

	Abstract = {The often poor correlation between luminance and perceived brightness has been attributed to the facts that first, the CIE standard luminous efficiency function V(Λ) does not represent adequately heterochromatic brightness matching of monochromatic stimuli, and second, the additivity law does not always hold in heterochromatic brightness matching. By means of a variation of the traditional experimental procedures, Guth found that two types of additivity failure can occur: additivity failures of the enhancement type and of the cancellation type. It is shown here that the two types of additivity failure can also be deduced by calculation from brightness-matching data obtained by the traditional experimental procedure. However, the magnitude of the additivity failures and sometimes the type of failure seem to depend strongly upon the individual observers involved. New experimental data confirm Guth's results except in the middle region of the spectrum. Whereas Guth's observers find additivity failures of the cancellation type between 500 and 600 nm, the new data suggest that in that region additivity holds fairly well.},

@article{Greenwood:2012fk,
	Abstract = {Crowding--the deleterious influence of clutter on object recognition--disrupts the identification of visual features as diverse as orientation, motion, and color. It is unclear whether this occurs via independent feature-specific crowding processes (preceding the feature binding process) or via a singular (late) mechanism tuned for combined features. To examine the relationship between feature binding and crowding, we measured interactions between the crowding of relative position and orientation. Stimuli were a target cross and two flanker crosses (each composed of two near-orthogonal lines), 15 degrees in the periphery. Observers judged either the orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) of the near-horizontal target line, its position (up/down relative to the stimulus center), or both. For single-feature judgments, crowding affected position and orientation similarly: thresholds were elevated and responses biased in a manner suggesting that the target appeared more like the flankers. These effects were tuned for orientation, with near-orthogonal elements producing little crowding. This tuning allowed us to separate the predictions of independent (feature specific) and combined (singular) models: for an independent model, reduced crowding for one feature has no effect on crowding for other features, whereas a combined process affects either all features or none. When observers made conjoint judgments, a reduction of orientation crowding (by increasing target-flanker orientation differences) increased the rate of correct responses for both position and orientation, as predicted by our combined model. In contrast, our independent model incorrectly predicted a high rate of position errors, since the probability of positional crowding would be unaffected by changes in orientation. Thus, at least for these features, crowding is a singular process that affects bound position and orientation values in an all-or-none fashion.},

We examined how contrast, coherence and directional selectivity interact by measuring directional tuning psychophysically across a wide range of coherence and contrast levels. We fit data with a simple model that estimated directional tuning bandwidth using contrast and coherence gain parameters that were based on neurophysiological estimates. This model estimated a bandwidth of approximately 90 degrees for directionally selective mechanisms. Bandwidth was invariant across a wide range of contrasts and coherences, as predicted by models of contrast normalization.},

	Abstract = {Aubert and Foerster (1857) are frequently cited for having shown that the lower visual acuity of peripheral vision can be compensated for by increasing stimulus size. This result is seemingly consistent with the concept of cortical magnification, and it has been confirmed by many subsequent authors. Yet it is rarely noted that Aubert and Foerster also observed a loss of the "quality of form." We have studied the recognition of numeric characters in foveal and eccentric vision by determining the contrast required for 67% correct identification. At each eccentricity, the lowest contrast threshold is achieved with a specific stimulus size. But the contrast thresholds for these optimal stimuli are not independent of retinal eccentricity as cortical magnification scaling would predict. With high-contrast targets, however, threshold target sizes were consistent with cortical magnification out to 6 degrees eccentricity. Beyond 6 degrees, threshold target sizes were larger than cortical magnification predicted. We also investigated recognition performance in the presence of neighboring characters (crowding phenomenon). Target character size, distance of flanking characters, and precision of focusing of attention all affect recognition. The influence of these parameters is different in the fovea and in the periphery. Our findings confirm Aubert and Foester's original observation of a qualitative difference between foveal and peripheral vision.},

	Abstract = {The sense of form is poor in indirect view. Yet the cortical magnification theory asserts that the disadvantage can be made up by scaling the image size according to the spatial variation in the mapping of the retina onto the cortex. It is thus assumed that all visual information passes through a functionally homogeneous neural circuitry, with the spatial sampling of input signals varying across the visual field. We challenge this notion by showing that character recognition in the visual field cannot be accommodated by any concept of sole size scaling but requires increasing both size and contrast of the target being viewed. This finding is formalized into a hyperbolic law which states that target size multiplied by log contrast is constant across the visual field. We conclude that the scalar cortical magnification theory fails for character recognition since the latter depends on multidimensional pattern representations in higher, i.e. striate and prestriate, cortical areas.},

	Abstract = {In slapstick comedy, the worst thing that could happen usually does: The person with a sore toe manages to stub it, sometimes twice. Such errors also arise in daily life, and research traces the tendency to do precisely the worst thing to ironic processes of mental control. These monitoring processes keep us watchful for errors of thought, speech, and action and enable us to avoid the worst thing in most situations, but they also increase the likelihood of such errors when we attempt to exert control under mental load (stress, time pressure, or distraction). Ironic errors in attention and memory occur with identifiable brain activity and prompt recurrent unwanted thoughts; attraction to forbidden desires; expression of objectionable social prejudices; production of movement errors; and rebounds of negative experiences such as anxiety, pain, and depression. Such ironies can be overcome when effective control strategies are deployed and mental load is minimized.},

	Abstract = {Eye movements are an integral and essential part of our human foveated vision system. Here, we review recent work on voluntary eye movements, with an emphasis on the last decade. More selectively, we address two of the most important questions about saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements in natural vision. First, why do we saccade to where we do? We argue that, like for many other aspects of vision, several different circuits related to salience, object recognition, actions, and value ultimately interact to determine gaze behavior. Second, how are pursuit eye movements and perceptual experience of visual motion related? We show that motion perception and pursuit have a lot in common, but they also have separate noise sources that can lead to dissociations between them.

	Abstract = {This is a survey of psychophysical studies of motion perception carried out mainly in the last 10 years. It covers a wide range of topics, including the detection and interactions of local motion signals, motion integration across various dimensions for vector computation and global motion perception, second-order motion and feature tracking, motion aftereffects, motion-induced mislocalizations, timing of motion processing, cross-attribute interactions for object motion, motion-induced blindness, and biological motion. While traditional motion research has benefited from the notion of the independent "motion processing module," recent research efforts have been also directed to aspects of motion processing in which interactions with other visual attributes play critical roles. This review tries to highlight the richness and diversity of this large research field and to clarify what has been done and what questions have been left unanswered.},

	Abstract = {Much of our interaction with the visual world requires us to isolate some currently important objects from other less important objects. This task becomes more difficult when objects move, or when our field of view moves relative to the world, requiring us to track these objects over space and time. Previous experiments have shown that observers can track a maximum of about 4 moving objects. A natural explanation for this capacity limit is that the visual system is architecturally limited to handling a fixed number of objects at once, a so-called magical number 4 on visual attention. In contrast to this view, Experiment 1 shows that tracking capacity is not fixed. At slow speeds it is possible to track up to 8 objects, and yet there are fast speeds at which only a single object can be tracked. Experiment 2 suggests that that the limit on tracking is related to the spatial resolution of attention. These findings suggest that the number of objects that can be tracked is primarily set by a flexibly allocated resource, which has important implications for the mechanisms of object tracking and for the relationship between object tracking and other cognitive processes.},

	Abstract = {Much evidence suggests that visual motion can cause severe distortions in the perception of spatial position. In this study, we show that visual motion also distorts saccadic eye movements. Landing positions of saccades performed to objects presented in the vicinity of visual motion were biased in the direction of motion. The targeting errors for both saccades and perceptual reports were maximum during motion onset and were of very similar magnitude under the two conditions. These results suggest that visual motion affects a representation of spatial position, or spatial map, in a similar fashion for visuomotor action as for perception.},

@article{gepshtein2010two,
	Abstract = {
Two traditions have had a great impact on the theoretical and experimental research 
of perception. One tradition is statistical, stretching from Fechner's enunciation 
of psychophysics in 1860 to the modern view of perception as statistical decision making. 
The other tradition is phenomenological, from Brentano's ``empirical standpoint'' of 
1874 to the Gestalt movement and the modern work on perceptual organization. Each 
tradition has at its core a distinctive assumption about the indivisible constituents of 
perception: the just-noticeable differences of sensation in the tradition of Fechner vs. the 
phenomenological Gestalts in the tradition of Brentano. But some key results from the 
two traditions can be explained and connected using an approach that is neither 
statistical nor phenomenological. This approach rests on a basic property of any 
information exchange: a principle of measurement formulated in 1946 by Gabor as a 
part of his quantal theory of information. Here the indivisible components are units 
(quanta) of information that remain invariant under changes of precision of 
measurement. This approach helped to understand how sensory measurements are 
implemented by single neural cells. But recent analyses suggest that this approach has the 
power to explain larger-scale characteristics of sensory systems. },

	Abstract = {Binding of features helps object recognition in contour integration but hinders it in crowding. In contour integration, aligned adjacent objects group together to form a path. In crowding, flanking objects make the target unidentifiable. However, to date, the two tasks have only been studied separately. K. A. May and R. F. Hess (2007) suggested that the same binding mediates both tasks. To test this idea, we ask observers to perform two different tasks with the same stimulus. We present oriented grating patches that form a "snake letter" in the periphery. Observers report either the identity of the whole letter (contour integration task) or the phase of one of the grating patches (crowding task). We manipulate the strength of binding between gratings by varying the alignment between them, i.e., the Gestalt goodness of continuation, measured as "wiggle." We find that better alignment strengthens binding, which improves contour integration and worsens crowding. Observers show equal sensitivity to alignment in these two very different tasks, suggesting that the same binding mechanism underlies both phenomena. It has been claimed that grouping among flankers reduces their crowding of the target. Instead, we find that these published cases of weak crowding are due to weak binding resulting from target-flanker misalignment. We conclude that crowding is mediated solely by the grouping of flankers with the target and is independent of grouping among flankers.},

	Abstract = {The motion aftereffect is a robust illusion of visual motion resulting from exposure to a moving pattern. There is a widely accepted explanation of it in terms of changes in the response of cortical direction-selective neurons. Research has distinguished several variants of the effect. Converging recent evidence from different experimental techniques (psychophysics, single-unit recording, brain imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual evoked potentials and magnetoencephalography) reveals that adaptation is not confined to one or even two cortical areas, but occurs at multiple levels of processing involved in visual motion analysis. A tentative motion-processing framework is described, based on motion aftereffect research. Recent ideas on the function of adaptation see it as a form of gain control that maximises the efficiency of information transmission at multiple levels of the visual pathway.},

	Abstract = {Optic flow-large-field rotational and radial motion-is processed as efficiently as translational motion for first-order (luminance-defined) stimuli. However, it has been suggested recently that the same pattern does not hold for second-order (e.g. contrast-defined) stimuli. We used random dot kinematogram (RDK) stimuli to determine whether global processing of optic flow is as efficient as processing of global translational motion for both first- and second-order stimuli. For first-order stimuli, we found that coherence thresholds for radial and rotational motion were equivalent to thresholds for translational motion, supporting previous findings. For second-order stimuli we found, firstly, that given sufficient contrast, second-order optic flow can be processed as efficiently as first-order optic flow and, secondly, that rotational and translational second-order motion are processed with equal efficiency. This contradicts the suggestion that there is a loss of efficiency between integration of second-order global motion and second-order optic flow. The third interesting finding was that the processing of radial second-order motion appears to suffer from a deficit that is dependent upon both the contrast and spatial extent of the stimulus. Further experiments discounted the possibility that the observed deficit is caused by a centrifugal or centripetal bias, but demonstrated that a longer temporal integration period for radial second-order motion is responsible for the observed difference. For durations of approximately 850ms, all three types of motion are processed with equal efficiency.},

@article{Carlson:2007bh,
	Abstract = {Our conscious experience is of a seamless visual world, but many of the cortical areas that underlie our capacity for vision have a fragmented or asymmetrical representation of visual space. In fact, the representation of the visual field is fragmented into quadrants at the level of V2, V3, and possibly V4. In theory, this division could have no functional consequences and therefore no impact on behavior. Contrary to this expectation, we find robust quadrant-level interference effects when attentively tracking two moving targets. Performance improves when target objects appear in separate quadrants (straddling either the horizontal or vertical meridian) compared with when they appear the same distance apart but within a single quadrant. These quadrant-level interference effects would not be predicted by cognitive theories of attention and tracking that do not take anatomical constraints into account. Quadrant-level interference strongly suggests that cortical areas containing a noncontiguous representation of the four quadrants of the visual field (i.e., V2, V3, and V4) impose an important constraint on attentional selection and attentive tracking.},

	Abstract = {Crowding (mutual scrambling of nearby peripheral stimuli) has several known asymmetries. We explored these and other asymmetries systematically across the visual field. Crowding strength for 16 target (Gabor) positions in the visual field (8 directions × 2 eccentricities) were determined by positioning a plaid mask made of two transparently overlaid Gabors either inward, outward, clockwise, or counter-clockwise around the target. Overall, we found a surprisingly large individual variation in crowding strength appearing as idiosyncratic hotspots across the visual field. No correlations were found between the idiosyncratic variations of crowding and visual acuity either across the visual field or across subjects. When averaged across observers the results replicated most of the previously reported asymmetries of crowding. No new types of asymmetries were observed, but we found that the inward-outward asymmetry of crowding is present only along the horizontal meridian. Most surprisingly, we discovered that this asymmetry increases two-fold, if the observer is forced to attend to both left and right visual fields. This indicates that besides other factors attention allocation has a strong effect on the crowding asymmetry.},

@article{Liu:2009ly,
	Abstract = {When embedded in adjacent distractors, a target becomes more difficult to perceive. The neural mechanism for this ubiquitous visual crowding effect remains unresolved. Stimuli presented on opposite sides of the vertical meridian initially project to different hemispheres, whereas stimuli with the same spatial distance but presented to one side of the vertical meridian project to the same hemisphere. Dissociation between visual spatial distance and cortical distance can also be found in V2 and V3 (quadrant representations of the visual hemifield) along the horizontal meridian. In the current study, we observed a strong crowding effect from spatially adjacent distractors with either Gabor or letter targets presented near the vertical or horizontal meridian. Interestingly, for a target presented near the vertical meridian, a distractor from the same side of the meridian (cortically near) had a significantly stronger crowding effect compared with an equidistant distractor presented on the opposite side (cortically remote). No such meridian modulation was observed across the horizontal meridian. These results constrain the cortical locus of the crowding effect to a stage in which left and right visual spaces are represented discontinuously but the upper and lower visual fields are represented continuously, likely beyond the early retinotopic areas.},

	Abstract = {Converging psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence suggests that first-order (luminance-defined) complex motion types i.e., radial and rotational motion, are processed by specialized extrastriate motion mechanisms. We ask whether radial and rotational second-order (texture-defined) motion patterns are processed in a similar manner. The motion sensitivity to translating, radiating and rotating motion patterns of both first-order (luminance-modulated noise) and second-order (contrast-modulated noise) were measured for patterns presented at four different exposure durations (106, 240, 500 and 750 ms). No significant difference in motion sensitivity was found across motion type for the first-order motion class across exposure duration (i.e., from 240 to 750 ms) whereas direction-identification thresholds for radiating and rotating second-order motion were significantly greater than that of the second-order translational stimuli. Furthermore, thresholds to all second-order motion stimuli increased at a significantly faster rate with decreasing exposure duration compared to those of first-order motion. Interestingly, simple and complex second-order thresholds increased at similar rates. Taken together, the results suggest that complex second-order motion is not analyzed in a sequential manner. Rather, it seems that the same 'hard-wired' mechanisms responsible for complex first-order motion processing also mediate complex second-order motion, but not before the pre-processing (i.e., rectification) of local second-order motion signals.},

	Abstract = {Motion aftereffects are normally tested in regions of the visual field that have been directly exposed to motion (local or concrete MAEs). We compared concrete MAEs with remote or phantom MAEs, in which motion is perceived in regions not previously adapted to motion. Our aim was to study the spatial dependencies and spatiotemporal tuning of phantom MAEs generated by radially expanding stimuli. For concrete and phantom MAEs, peripheral stimuli generated stronger aftereffects than central stimuli. Concrete MAEs display temporal frequency tuning, while phantom MAEs do not show categorical temporal frequency or velocity tuning. We found that subjects may use different response strategies to determine motion direction when presented with different stimulus sizes. In some subjects, as adapting stimulus size increased, phantom MAE strength increased while the concrete MAE strength decreased; in other subjects, the opposite effects were observed. We hypothesise that these opposing findings reflect interplay between the adaptation of global motion sensors and local motion sensors with inhibitory interconnections.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrophysiological recording from the extrastriate cortex of non-human primates has revealed neurons that have large receptive fields and are sensitive to various components of object or self movement, such as translations, rotations and expansion/contractions. If these mechanisms exist in human vision, they might be susceptible to adaptation that generates motion aftereffects (MAEs). Indeed, it might be possible to adapt the mechanism in one part of the visual field and reveal what we term a 'phantom MAE' in another part.
RESULTS: The existence of phantom MAEs was probed by adapting to a pattern that contained motion in only two non-adjacent 'quarter' segments and then testing using patterns that had elements in only the other two segments. We also tested for the more conventional 'concrete' MAE by testing in the same two segments that had adapted. The strength of each MAE was quantified by measuring the percentage of dots that had to be moved in the opposite direction to the MAE in order to nullify it. Four experiments tested rotational motion, expansion/contraction motion, translational motion and a 'rotation' that consisted simply of the two segments that contained only translational motions of opposing direction. Compared to a baseline measurement where no adaptation took place, all subjects in all experiments exhibited both concrete and phantom MAEs, with the size of the latter approximately half that of the former.
CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation to two segments that contained upward and downward motion induced the perception of leftward and rightward motion in another part of the visual field. This strongly suggests there are mechanisms in human vision that are sensitive to complex motions such as rotations.},

	Abstract = {We report that spatial cueing of a parafoveal target in the presence of distractors enhances orientational acuity for that target. When no distractors were present, orientation thresholds were in the range 1-4 degrees. For long exposure times, distractors increased threshold by the amount predicted from a winner-takes-all spatial uncertainty model. For short (100-msec) exposures followed by a random dot mask, the rise in threshold with distractors was considerably greater than that predicted from spatial uncertainty. For brief exposures the effect of distractors was greater when the target and distractors were spatially crowded rather than widely spaced. Adding a tilt to the distractors in the opposite direction to the target increased thresholds still further. Cueing the target with a spatial pointer decreased the effect of distractors, even when they were crowded. We suggest that when attention cannot be appropriately focused, discrimination is carried out by a relatively coarse texture analyser, which averages over several elements, and that focused attention permits the analysis of the target over a smaller area of space.},

@article{Mareschal:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Differences between target and flanker orientations become exaggerated in the tilt illusion. However, small differences sometimes go unnoticed. This small-angle assimilation shares many similarities with other types of visual crowding but is typically found only with small and/or hard-to-see stimuli. In Experiment 1, we investigated the effect of stimulus visibility on orientation bias using relatively large stimuli. The introduction of visual noise increased the perceived similarity of target and flanker orientations at retinal eccentricities of 4$\,^{\circ}$ and 10$\,^{\circ}$; however, small-angle assimilation was found only at 10$\,^{\circ}$. The effects of eccentricity were reduced in Experiment 2, when our stimuli were "M-scaled" for equal cortical coverage. Further support for a cortical substrate was obtained in Experiment 3, in which the effects of target-flanker separation were measured. When biases from all three experiments are expressed as a fraction of the inducing flankers' angle, and plotted as a function of the approximate cortical separation between the target and its closest flanker, they form a curve like the cross-section of half a Mexican hat. We conclude that the tilt illusion and small-angle assimilation reflect opponent influences on orientation perception. The strength of each influence increases with cortical proximity and stimulus visibility, but the one responsible for assimilation has a lesser extent.},

	Abstract = {Four pairs of spots rotating around their common centers, each pair a "doublet", were arranged in a square formation. The doublets initially appear to rotate "locally", but then coalesce into two large squares that slide over each other along circular paths ("global" motion). This perceptual transition from local to global motion occurred within and across a series of repeat trials (Experiment 1). Doublet members set close or far apart promoted local or global motion respectively. Increasing the number of spots within a group from two to three or four made the motion look more local. Spots of the same luminance polarity against a gray background tended to move together (Experiment 2); and when replaced by short black lines of different orientations, lines of the same orientation tended to move together, favoring rigid rather than shearing motions (Experiment 3). The perceived trajectories of spots tended to follow static circles or dynamic contours painted on the screen (Experiment 4). These findings suggest the visual system parsimoniously attempts to group the maximum number of moving spots into the minimum number of groups.},

	Abstract = {Humans are extremely sensitive to visual motion, largely because local motion signals can be integrated over a large spatial region. On the other hand, summation is often not advantageous, for example when segmenting a moving stimulus against a stationary or oppositely moving background. In this study we show that the spatial extent of motion integration is not compulsory, but is subject to voluntary attentional control. Measurements of motion coherence sensitivity with summation and search paradigms showed that human observers can combine motion signals from cued regions or patches in an optimal manner, even when the regions are quite distinct and remote from each other. Further measurements of contrast sensitivity reinforce previous studies showing that motion integration is preceded by a local analysis akin to contrast thresholding (or intrinsic uncertainty). The results were well modelled by two standard signal-detection-theory models.},

The polar angle representation in LO2 was the mirror-reversal of that in LO1. LO1 and LO2 overlapped with the posterior part of the object-selective lateral occipital complex and the kinetic occipital region (KO). The retinotopy and functional properties of LO1 and LO2 suggest that they correspond to two new human visual areas, which lack exact homologues in macaque visual cortex. The topography, stimulus selectivity, and anatomical location of LO1 and LO2 indicate that they integrate shape information from multiple visual submodalities in retinotopic coordinates.},

	Abstract = {We studied 'crowding' in the parafovea using orientation identification of a Gabor target as the task, and flanking Gabors on an isoeccentric circle as distractors. Orientation-discrimination thresholds were raised by nearby flanking distractors. This crowding effect was increased by the number of distractors and decreased by the spatial separation between target and distractors. Crowding was greatest when the target was in the centre of the distractor array and smallest when the target was on the edge of the array. A cue indicating the position of the target improved performance when the position was otherwise unknown and the spatial separation between target and distractors was large, but the cue had no significant effect when separation was small. Increasing the contrast of the target relative to the distractors reduced crowding, but targets of smaller contrast than that of the distractors are even harder to identify than those of the same contrast. Putting the target and distractors in different depth planes decreased crowding for some observers, but there were qualitative individual differences. A large (say, 45 degrees) difference in orientation between target and distractors caused the target to 'pop out' in a presence/absence task, despite the evidence from other studies that crowding is still found in these conditions. We conclude that salience has, at best, modest effects on crowding.},

	Abstract = {We investigated whether transient covert attention would differentially affect 'performance fields' (shape depicted by percent correct performance at particular locations in the visual field) for orientation discrimination, detection and localization tasks, while manipulating a number of visual factors. We found that although attention improved overall performance, it did not affect performance fields. Two patterns were observed regardless of the presence of a local post-mask, the stimulus orientation, or the task. A horizontal-vertical anisotropy (HVA) became more pronounced as spatial frequency, eccentricity and set size increased. A vertical meridian asymmetry (VMA) became more pronounced as spatial frequency and eccentricity increased. We conclude that performance fields are determined by visual, rather than by transient attentional, constraints.},

	Abstract = {We enjoy the illusion that visual resolution is high across the entire field of vision. However, this illusion can be easily dispelled by trying to identify objects in a cluttered environment out of the corner of your eye. This reflects, in part, the well-known decline in visual resolution in peripheral vision; however, the main bottleneck for reading or object recognition in peripheral vision is crowding. Objects that can be easily identified in isolation seem indistinct and jumbled in clutter. Crowding is thought to reflect inappropriate integration of the target and flankers in peripheral vision [1, 2]. Here, we uncover and explain a paradox in peripheral crowding: under certain conditions, increasing the size or number of flanking rings results in a paradoxical decrease in the magnitude of crowding-i.e., the bigger or more numerous the flanks, the smaller the crowding. These surprising results are predicted by a model in which crowding is determined by the centroids of approximately 4-8 independent features within approximately 0.5x the target eccentricity. These features are then integrated into a texture beyond the stage of feature analysis. We speculate that this process may contribute to the illusion of high resolution across the field of vision.},

	Abstract = {Crowding, the inability to recognize objects in clutter, sets a fundamental limit on conscious visual perception and object recognition throughout most of the visual field. Despite how widespread and essential it is to object recognition, reading and visually guided action, a solid operational definition of what crowding is has only recently become clear. The goal of this review is to provide a broad-based synthesis of the most recent findings in this area, to define what crowding is and is not, and to set the stage for future work that will extend our understanding of crowding well beyond low-level vision. Here we define six diagnostic criteria for what counts as crowding, and further describe factors that both escape and break crowding. All of these lead to the conclusion that crowding occurs at multiple stages in the visual hierarchy.},

	Abstract = { Existing theories of multiple object tracking (MOT) offer different predictions concerning the role of higher level cognitive processes, individual differences, effortful attention and parallel processing in MOT. Pylyshyn's model (1989) argues for an automatic parallel processing mechanism separate from other cognition, whereas alternative models (e.g., Kahneman & Treisman, 1984 or spotlight models) are based on higher level cognition such as spatial short‐term memory and/or effortful attention switching. These predictions were examined in Experiment 1 where identical objects and in Experiment 2 where visually and semantically distinct objects were tracked. Both experiments demonstrated a substantial individual variation in the estimated tracking capacity. Tasks measuring visuospatial short‐term memory and attention switching proved to be significant predictors of MOT. In addition, tracking performance deteriorated as a function of tracking time and set size. Our results are in contrast to Pylyshyn's model. A mechanism with both parallel and serial processing and temporary spatial memory is outlined to accommodate the observed pattern of results. },

	Abstract = {Thirty randomly oriented T's were presented in a circle around fixation at an eccentricity of 11 degrees such that each T was crowded by its neighbors. Two locations within the same hemifield (unilateral condition) or one location in each hemifield (bilateral condition) were precued for subsequent probing. Observers were then asked to report the orientation of a target T at one of these locations. A bilateral field advantage was found: target identification was better when the two precued targets were in different hemifields than when they were within the same hemifield. This bilateral advantage was absent when only targets were presented, without any distracters. Further controls showed that this advantage could not be attributed to differences between horizontal and vertical target alignments or to visual field anisotropies. A similar bilateral advantage has been reported for multiple object tracking (Alvarez, G. A., \& Cavanagh, P. (2005). Independent resources for attentional tracking in the left and right visual fields. Psychological Science 16(8), 637-643) and other attentional tasks.

Specifically, twice as many targets can be successfully tracked when they are divided between the left and right hemifields as when they are all presented within the same hemifield.

@article{Yantis:1992fk,
	Abstract = {Two types of theories have been advanced to account for how attention is allocated in performing goal-directed visual tasks. According to location-based theories, visual attention is allocated to spatial locations in the image; according to object-based theories, attention is allocated to perceptual objects. Evidence for the latter view comes from experiments demonstrating the importance of perceptual grouping in selective-attention tasks. This article provides further evidence concerning the importance of perceptual organization in attending to objects. In seven experiments, observers tracked multiple randomly moving visual elements under a variety of conditions. Ten elements moved continuously about the display for several seconds; one to five of them were designated as targets before movement initiation. At the end of movement, one element was highlighted, and subjects indicated whether or not it was a target. The ease with which the elements in the target set could be perceptually grouped was systematically manipulated. In Experiments 1-3, factors that influenced the initial formation of a perceptual group were manipulated; this affected performance, but only early in practice. In Experiments 4-7, factors that influenced the maintenance of a perceptual group during motion were manipulated; this affected performance throughout practice. The results suggest that observers spontaneously grouped the target elements and directed attention toward this coherent but nonrigid virtual object. This supports object-based theories of attention and demonstrates that perceptual grouping, which is usually conceived of as a purely stimulus-driven process, can also be governed by goal-directed mechanisms.},

@article{Carney:1987zr,
	Abstract = {When the two eyes are confronted with sufficiently different versions of the visual environment, one or the other eye dominates perception in alternation. A similar situation may be created in the laboratory by presenting images to the left and right eyes which differ in orientation or colour. Although perception is dominated by one eye during rivalry, there are a number of instances in which visual processes nevertheless continue to integrate information from the suppressed eye. For example the interocular transfer of the motion after-effect is undiminished when induced during binocular rivalry. Thus motion information processing may occur in parallel with the rivalry process. Here we describe a novel example in which the visual system simultaneously exhibits binocular rivalry and vision that integrates signals from both eyes. This apparent contradiction is resolved by postulating parallel visual processes devoted to the analyses of colour and motion information. Counterphased gratings are viewed dichoptically such that for one eye the grating is composed of alternating yellow and black stripes (luminance) while for the other it is composed of alternating red and green stripes (chrominance). When the gratings are fused, a moving grating is perceived. A consistent direction of motion can only be achieved if left and right monocular signals are integrated by the nervous system. Yet the apparent colour of the binocular percept alternates between red-green and yellow-black. These observations demonstrate the segregation of processing by the early motion system from that affording the perception of colour. Although, in this stimulus, colour information in itself can play no part in the cyclopean perception of motion direction, colour is carried along perceptually (filled in) by the moving pattern which is integrated from both eyes.},

	Abstract = {There is a wealth of anatomical and psychological evidence which suggests that when people look at an object in the visual world, its various attributes such as colour, 'form', motion and depth are analysed by separate channels in the visual system. If so, how are these attributes put back together again to create a unified picture of the object? And if the object moves rapidly, how is perfect perceptual synchrony maintained between different features on its surface, if it is indeed true that they are being processed separately? Our evidence suggests that the visual system extracts certain conspicuous image features based on luminance contrast, and that the signals derived from these are then attributed to other features on the object, a process that we call 'capture'. Specifically, we find that when either illusory contours or random-dot patterns are moved in the vicinity of a colour-border, the colour border will also seem to move in the same direction even though it is physically stationary.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments demonstrated motion capture of luminance-defined dots by gratings with no net luminance-based motion. In a series of two-frame experimental trials, we superimposed bright dots and a color grating rotating in opposite directions. Capture was observed at equiluminance and was facilitated by the presence of color in gratings over a range of luminance contrasts. In a second experiment, observers noted that when a counterphase grating was tracked in either direction with attention, the superimposed dots were captured in that direction. These results suggest motion capture is supported not only by luminance-based motion, but also by color- and attention-based motion. Indeed, we suggest that the most parsimonious explanation is that all capture is mediated by attention.},

	Abstract = {Loud bangs, bright flashes, and intense shocks capture attention, but other changes--even those of similar magnitude--can go unnoticed. Demonstrations of change blindness have shown that observers fail to detect substantial alterations to a scene when distracted by an irrelevant flash, or when the alterations happen gradually [1-5]. Here, we show that objects changing in hue, luminance, size, or shape appear to stop changing when they move. This motion-induced failure to detect change, silencing, persists even though the observer attends to the objects, knows that they are changing, and can make veridical judgments about their current state. Silencing demonstrates the tight coupling of motion and object appearance.},

@article{Ramachandran:1987fk,
	Abstract = {Two uncorrelated random dot patterns were superimposed and alternated to produce dynamic incoherent noise. When a low spatial frequency sine wave grating was optically superimposed on this noise and moved in step with the alternation of the two frames, the incoherent motion was masked and all the dots were seen to adhere to the grating and to move with it as a single rigid sheet ("Motion Capture"). Over a wide range of displacements subjects could not discriminate uncorrelated noise which was "captured" from correlated noise patterns which moved physically in the same direction as the grating. In fact the motion signal from the low frequency grating was even strong enough to overcome signals from two correlated random dot patterns which moved in the opposite direction. Capture was not as strong if the direction of dot motion was orthogonal to the direction of grating motion. We conclude that in any dynamic visual scene the motion of certain salient features in the image tends to dominate our perceptual experience. The signal from low frequencies masks or inhibits the signal from the high frequencies. Since the latter now have no motion signal of their own they are assumed to move with the low frequencies. Thus, motion capture suggests an important biological role for long-range apparent motion: the process serves to preserve continuity of object identity while at the same time eliminating spurious motion signals that arise from finer image features. In this manner the visual system solves the "correspondence problem" without benefit from either computation or cognition.},

	Abstract = {We used a psychophysical summation technique to study the properties of detectors tuned to radial, circular and translational motion, and to determine the spatial extent of their receptive fields. Signal-to-noise motion thresholds were measured for patterns curtailed spatially in various ways. Sensitivity for radial, circular and translational motion increased with stimulus area at a rate predicted by an ideal integrator. When sectors of noise were added to the stimulus, sensitivity decreased at a rate consistent with an ideal integrator. Summation was tested for large annular stimuli, and shown to hold up to 70 degrees in some cases, suggesting very large receptive fields for this type of motion (consistent with the physiology of neurones in the dorsal region of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd)). This is a far greater area than observed for summation of contrast sensitivity to gratings (Anderson SJ and Burr DC, Vis Res 1987;29:621-635, and to this type of stimuli (Morrone MC, Burr DC and Vaina LM, Nature 1995;376:507-509, consistent with the suggestion that the two techniques examine different levels of motion analysis.},

	Abstract = {In the stimulus configuration for "motion capture" phenomenon, we varied luminance contrast of the center disk (target), eccentricity and stimulus size. The subjects had to judge the direction of perceived target motion. We found that motion capture changed to induced motion (the direction of illusory motion was reversed) at smaller eccentricities and larger stimulus sizes. At intermediate eccentricities, motion capture changed to induced motion with increasing luminance contrast of the target. By using magnitude estimation, we also found that even a luminance-defined target was captured ("homochromatic motion capture") and that a moving target was captured by a stationary inducer ("position capture"). Both motion and position capture effects were commonly observed at lower luminance contrasts of the target, larger eccentricities and smaller sizes. From these results, we propose a model of center-surround antagonistic motion contrast detectors in motion processing.},

The stimulus was made up of Gabor function micro-patterns randomly distributed across the stimulus field. We show that for short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) performance can be predicted from the spatio-temporal Fourier power spectrum of the stimulus, whereas for long SOAs the pattern of performance is qualitatively different from such a prediction. The dependence of motion perception on SOA exhibits an abrupt change from one mode of behaviour to the other. These findings are suggestive of the operation of distinct mechanisms, one "quasi-linear" and one "nonlinear", which can be separated by temporal parameters.},

	Abstract = {The maximum displacement for the detection of apparent motion (Dmax) is measured using stimuli made up of Gabor function micro-patterns randomly distributed across the stimulus field. Previous studies using high densities of micro-patterns have demonstrated Dmax to be dependent on the spatial frequency content of the stimulus and not the size of the stimulus elements. Here we report that Dmax increases suddenly when the number of micro-patterns in the visual field is reduced beyond some critical point. The number of micro-patterns at which the transition in Dmax occurs is found to be inversely proportional to the width of the micro-patterns along the axis of motion. Beyond this transition, for low density stimuli, Dmax is found to be dependent on both the number and size of micro-patterns in the stimulus field. These results are suggestive of the operation of different motion mechanisms under conditions of low vs high micro-pattern density.},

	Abstract = {Six observers were asked to indicate in which of two opposite directions, to the right or to the left, an entire display appeared to move, based on the proportion of right vs leftward motion elements, each of which was distinctly visible. The performance of each observer was described by Thurstone's discriminative processes and Bernoulli trial models which described empirical psychometric functions equally well. Although formally it was impossible to discriminate between these two models, treating observer as a counting device which measures a randomly selected subsample of all available motion elements had certain advantages. According to the Bernoulli trial model decisions about the global motion direction in a range of 12-800 elements were based on taking into account about 4$\pm$2 random moving dot elements. This small number is not due to cancellation of the opposite motion vectors since the motion direction recognition performance did not improve after the compared motion directions were made orthogonal. This may indicate that the motion pooling mechanism studied in our experiment is strongly limited in capacity.},

	Abstract = {We studied the perceptual integration of contours consisting of Gabor elements positioned along a smooth path, embedded among distractor elements. Contour elements either formed tangents to the path ("snakes") or were perpendicular to it ("ladders"). Perfectly straight snakes and ladders were easily detected in the fovea but, at an eccentricity of 6 degrees , only the snakes were detectable. The disproportionate impairment of peripheral ladder detection remained when we brought foveal performance away from ceiling by jittering the orientations of the elements. We propose that the failure to detect peripheral ladders is a form of crowding, the phenomenon observed when identification of peripherally located letters is disrupted by flanking letters. D. G. Pelli, M. Palomares, and N. J. Majaj (2004) outlined a model in which simple feature detectors are followed by integration fields, which are involved in tasks, such as letter identification, that require the outputs of several detectors. They proposed that crowding occurs because small integration fields are absent from the periphery, leading to inappropriate feature integration by large peripheral integration fields. We argue that the "association field," which has been proposed to mediate contour integration (D. J. Field, A. Hayes, \& R. F. Hess, 1993), is a type of integration field. Our data are explained by an elaboration of Pelli et al.'s model, in which weak ladder integration competes with strong snake integration. In the fovea, the association fields were small, and the model integrated snakes and ladders with little interference. In the periphery, the association fields were large, and integration of ladders was severely disrupted by interference from spurious snake contours. In contrast, the model easily detected snake contours in the periphery. In a further demonstration of the possible link between contour integration and crowding, we ran our contour integration model on groups of three-letter stimuli made from short line segments. Our model showed several key properties of crowding: The critical spacing for crowding to occur was independent of the size of the target letter, scaled with eccentricity, and was greater on the peripheral side of the target.},

	Abstract = {The influence of configuration on visual crowding was tested. Eight Gabor patches surrounding a central one were arranged in a way that created several global configurations differing by their internal arrangements (smooth contour vs. random), while still preserving pairwise relationships between the target and flankers. Orientation discrimination and contrast detection of the central Gabor were measured. These measurements revealed differences in the magnitude of crowding produced by the different configurations, especially on the discrimination task. The crowding effect was stronger when random configurations were used and was reduced considerably when a smooth one was used. These results showed the typical dependence of crowding on eccentricity and target-flanker separation, which was independent of the configural effect. Controlling flankers' local orientation allowed addressing the nature of the effect. It was found to be sensitive to spatial relations and did not represent a simple averaging of local orientation estimates. Our results show that crowding operates at a level where configuration information has already been extracted. We relate all this to the object-based nature of perception.},

@article{Greenwood:2010vn,
	Abstract = {Crowding is the breakdown in object recognition that occurs in cluttered visual environments and the fundamental limit on peripheral vision, affecting identification within many visual modalities and across large spatial regions. Though frequently characterized as a disruptive process through which object representations are suppressed or lost altogether, we demonstrate that crowding systematically changes the appearance of objects. In particular, target patches of visual noise that are surrounded ("crowded") by oriented Gabor flankers become perceptually oriented, matching the flankers. This was established with a change-detection paradigm: under crowded conditions, target changes from noise to Gabor went unnoticed when the Gabor orientation matched the flankers (and the illusory target percept), despite being easily detected when they differed. Rotation of the flankers (leaving target noise unaltered) also induced illusory target rotations. Blank targets led to similar results, demonstrating that crowding can induce apparent structure where none exists. Finally, adaptation to these stimuli induced a tilt aftereffect at the target location, consistent with signals from the flankers "spreading" across space. These results confirm predictions from change-based models of crowding, such as averaging, and establish crowding as a regularization process that simplifies the peripheral field by promoting consistent appearance among adjacent objects.},

@article{Dakin:2010kx,
	Abstract = {We investigated how crowding-a breakdown in object recognition that occurs in the presence of nearby distracting clutter-works for complex letter-like stimuli. Subjects reported the orientation (up/down/left/right) of a T target, abutted by a single flanker composed of randomly positioned horizontal and vertical bars. In addition to familiar retinotopic anisotropies (e.g., more crowding from more eccentric flankers), we report three object-centered anisotropies. First, inversions of the target element were rare: errors included twice as many $\pm$90$\,^{\circ}$ as 180$\,^{\circ}$ target rotations. Second, flankers were twice as intrusive when they lay above or below (end-flanking) compared to left or right (side-flanking) of an upright T target (an effect that holds under global rotation of the target-flanker pair). Third, end flankers induce subjects to make erroneous reports that resemble the flanker (producing a structured pattern of errors), but errors induced by side flankers do not (instead producing random errors). A model based on probabilistic weighted averaging of the feature positions within contours can account for these effects. Thus, we demonstrate a set of seemingly "high-level" object-centered crowding effects that can arise from "low-level" interactions between the features of letter-like elements.},

	Abstract = {Crowding by nearby features causes identification failures in the peripheral visual field. However, prominent visual features can sometimes fail to reach awareness, causing scenes to be incorrectly interpreted. Here we examine whether awareness of the flanking features is necessary for crowding to occur. Flankers that were physically present were rendered perceptually absent with adaptation-induced blindness. In a letter identification task, targets were presented unflanked or with up to four flanker letters. On each trial, observers reported both the number of letters they perceived and the identity of a target letter. This paradigm allowed trial-by-trial assessment of awareness and crowding and ensured that both targets and flankers were attended. Target-letter identification performance was correlated with the number of flanking letters that were perceived on a given trial, regardless of the number that were physically present. Our data demonstrate that crowding can be released when flanking elements at attended locations are suppressed from visual awareness.},

	Abstract = {Attention allows us to monitor objects or regions of visual space and select information from them for report or storage. Classical theories of attention assumed a single focus of selection but many everyday activities, such as video games, navigating busy intersections, or watching over children at a swimming pool, require attention to multiple regions of interest. Laboratory tracking tasks have indeed demonstrated the ability to track four or more targets simultaneously. Although the mechanisms by which attention maintains contact with several targets are not yet established, recent studies have identified several characteristics of the tracking process, including properties defining a 'trackable' target, the maximum number of targets that can be tracked, and the hemifield independence of the tracking process. This research also has implications for computer vision, where there is a growing demand for multiple-object tracking.},

	Abstract = {Peripheral vision is characterized by reduced spatial resolution and inhibitory spatial interactions that extend over long distances. This work had three goals. (1) We considered whether the extensive crowding in peripheral vision is a consequence of a shift in the spatial scale of analysis. To test this, using a large range of target sizes and spatial frequencies, we measured the extent of crowding for targets that were limited in their spatial frequency content. (2) We considered whether crowding in peripheral vision can be explained on the basis of contrast masking by remote flanks. To test this hypothesis, we measured and compared crowding in a direction-identification experiment with masking by remote flanks in a detection experiment. In each of the experiments, our targets and flanks were composed of Gabor features, thus allowing us to control the feature contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation. (3) We examined the relationship between the suppressive and facilitatory interactions in peripheral contrast detection and crowding. Our results show that unlike the normal fovea (Levi, Klein, \& Hariharan, 2002), peripheral crowding is not scale invariant nor is it attributable to simple contrast masking. Rather, our results suggest that inhibitory spatial interactions in peripheral crowding extend over larger distances than in the fovea for targets of the same size. In peripheral vision, the critical distance for crowding is approximately 0.1 times the target eccentricity. Observers can easily detect the features that compose our targets (Gabor patches) under conditions where crowding is strong. Thus, we speculate that peripheral crowding occurs because the target and flanks are combined or pooled at a second stage, following the stage of feature extraction. In peripheral vision, this pooling takes place over a large distance.},

	Abstract = {In the peripheral visual field, nearby objects can make one another difficult to recognize (crowding) in a manner that critically depends on their separation. We manipulated the apparent separation of objects using the illusory shifts in perceived location that arise from local motion to determine if crowding depends on physical or perceived location. Flickering Gabor targets displayed between either flickering or drifting flankers were used to (a) quantify the perceived target-flanker separation and (b) measure discrimination of the target orientation or spatial frequency as a function of physical target-flanker separation. Relative to performance with flickering targets, we find that flankers drifting away from the target improve discrimination, while those drifting toward the target degrade it. When plotted as a function of perceived separation across conditions, the data collapse onto a single function indicating that it is perceived and not physical location that determines the magnitude of visual crowding. There was no measurable spatial distortion of the target that could explain the effects. This suggests that crowding operates predominantly in extrastriate visual cortex and not in early visual areas where the response of neurons is retinotopically aligned with the physical position of a stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Physiological experiments indicate that the middle temporal visual area (MT) of primates plays a prominent role in the cortical analysis of visual motion. We investigated the role of MT in visual perception by examining the effect of chemical lesions of MT on psychophysical thresholds. We trained rhesus monkeys on psychophysical tasks that enabled us to assess their sensitivity to motion and to contrast. For motion psychophysics, we employed a dynamic random dot display that permitted us to vary the intensity of a motion signal in the midst of masking motion noise. We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into MT caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds. The results indicate that neural activity in MT contributes selectively to the perception of motion.},

	Abstract = {Several authors have proposed that motion is analyzed by two separate processes: short-range and long-range. We claim that the differences between short-range and long-range motion phenomena are a direct consequence of the stimuli used in the two paradigms and are not evidence for the existence of two qualitatively different motion processes. We propose that a single style of motion analysis, similar to the well known Reichardt and Marr-Ullman motion detectors, underlies all motion phenomena. Although there are different detectors of this type specialized for different visual attributes (namely first-order and second-order stimuli), they all share the same mode of operation. We review the studies of second-order motion stimuli to show that they share the basic phenomena observed for first-order stimuli. The similarity across stimulus types suggests, not parallel streams of motion extraction, one short-range and passive and the other long-range and intelligent, but a concatenation of a common mode of initial motion extraction followed by a general inference process.},

	Abstract = {Edwards and Badcock (Vision Research 35, 2589, 1995) argued for independent first-order (FO) and second-order (SO) motion systems up to and including the global-motion level. That study used luminance (which they called FO) and contrast (SO) modulated dots. They found that SO noise dots did not mask signal extraction with luminance increment dots while luminance increment dots did mask SO signal extraction. However, they argued this asymmetry was not due to a combined FO-SO pathway, but rather due to the fact that the luminance-modulated dots, being also local variations in contrast, are both FO and SO stimuli. We test their claim of FO and SO independence by using a stimulus that can generate pure FO and SO signals, specifically one consisting of multiple Gabors (the global-Gabor stimulus) in which the Gaussian envelopes are static and the carriers drift. The carrier can either be luminance-modulated (FO) or contrast-modulated (SO) and motion signals from the randomly-oriented local Gabors must be combined to detect the global-motion vector. Results show no cross-masking of FO and SO signals, thus supporting the hypothesis of independent FO and SO systems up to and including the level extracting optic-flow.},

@article{Edwards:1995fk,
	Abstract = {The experiments reported here address the issue of whether the pathways which extract motion from first-order and second-order spatial patterns remain separate or whether they combine at some higher level in the motion system to form a single pathway. The question is addressed by investigating the interaction of first-order and second-order stimuli in the processing of a global-motion stimulus [a variant of the task introduced by Newsome \& Pare (Journal of Neuroscience, 8, 2201-2211, (1988)]. Two experimental procedures were used. The first consisted of determining the effect of the addition of dots of one type (e.g. first order) undergoing purely random motion on the ability to extract the global-motion signal carried by dots of the other type (e.g. second order). The second experimental procedure consisted of determining the effect of maintaining a coherent-motion signal in one type of dot, moving in the opposite direction to the global-motion direction, on the ability to extract the global-motion signal carried by dots of the other type. The dots were matched for their effectiveness in producing a global motion percept and the results for both procedures were the same. First-order dots impaired the ability to extract second-order global-motion, and second-order dots had no effect on first-order global-motion extraction. It is argued that the sensitivity of the second-order global-motion system to the first-order dots is due to the ability of the second-order local-motion detectors to detect these dots. The present results are thus interpreted as indicating that the first-order and second-order motion pathways remain separate up to and including the level in the motion system at which global-motion signals are extracted.},

In these illusions reversed apparent motion is either induced or eliminated by the introduction of a blank inter-frame-interval between the frames of the apparent motion sequence. In order to simulate these effects with the multi-channel gradient model we had to introduce low-pass spatial filters and second-order temporal differentiating filters. These illusions have been used as evidence of multiple motion mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that they can be considered as emergent properties of a single computational strategy.},

@article{Butzer:1997ys,
	Abstract = {The perception of the displacement of luminance-defined contours (i.e., first-order motion) is an important and well-examined function of the visual system. It can be explained, for example, by the operation of elementary motion detectors (EMDs), which cross-correlate the spatiotemporal luminance distribution. More recent studies using second-order motion stimuli, i.e., shifts of the distribution of features such as contrast, texture, flicker, or motion, extended classic concepts of motion perception by including nonlinear or hierarchical processing in the EMD. Smooth-pursuit eye movements can be used as a direct behavioral probe for motion processing. The ability of the visual system to extract motion signals from the spatiotemporal changes of the retinal image can be addressed by analyzing the elicited eye movements. We measured the eye movement response to moving objects defined by two different types of first-order motion and two different types of second-order motion. Our results clearly showed that the direction of smooth-pursuit eye movements was always determined by the direction of object motion. In particular, in the case of second-order motion stimuli, smooth-pursuit did not follow the retinal image motion. The latency of the initial saccades during pursuit of second-order stimuli was slightly but significantly increased, compared with the latency of saccades elicited by first-order motion. The processing of second-order motion in the peripheral visual field was less exact than the processing of first-order motion in the peripheral field. Steady state smooth-pursuit eye speed did not reflect the velocity of second-order motion as precisely as that of first-order motion, and the resulting retinal error was compensated by saccades. Interestingly, for slow second-order stimuli we observed that the eye could move faster than the target, leading to small, corrective saccades in the opposite direction to the ongoing smooth-pursuit eye movement. We conclude from our results that both visual perception and the control of smooth-pursuit eye movements have access to processing mechanisms extracting first- and second-order motion.},

	Abstract = {In motion perception, luminance-defined stimuli (first-order motion) are distinguished from stimuli defined by more complex attributes (second-order motion), because they differ in their processing requirements. For instance, a two-layer model with the output of an array of elementary motion detectors (EMD's) feeding into a second array of EMD's has been proposed to account for seeing the movement of motion-defined objects. The question is raised whether this processing scheme is operating across the whole visual field or whether second-order motion perception is restricted to the fovea. The detection, orientation discrimination, and motion direction discrimination of oblique, vertically moving bars was tested at horizontal eccentricities between 0 degree and 16 degrees. Bars were defined on a dynamic noise background by an area of static dots (drift-balanced motion) or by coherent dot motion either in the direction of the bar motion (Fourier motion) or in the orthogonal direction (theta motion). Coherence thresholds for direction discrimination are severely impaired in the periphery for both types of second-order motion but not for Fourier motion, whereas orientation discrimination and detection marginally decline for all three bar types when the stimuli are presented further out in the periphery. In a control experiment it is shown that this result cannot be due entirely to the changes in spatial scale of the peripheral visual system. The facts that motion-defined objects can be detected in the periphery and that their orientation can be detected, but not their direction of motion, supports the view that the two-layer system suggested for the processing of theta motion is restricted to the central region of the visual field.},

	Abstract = {To some degree, all current models of visual motion-perception mechanisms depend on the power of the visual signal in various spatiotemporal-frequency bands. Here we show how to construct counterexamples: visual stimuli that are consistently perceived as obviously moving in a fixed direction yet for which Fourier-domain power analysis yields no systematic motion components in any given direction. We provide a general theoretical framework for investigating non-Fourier motion-perception mechanisms; central are the concepts of drift-balanced and microbalanced random stimuli. A random stimulus S is drift balanced if its expected power in the frequency domain is symmetric with respect to temporal frequency, that is, if the expected power in S of every drifting sinusoidal component is equal to the expected power of the sinusoid of the same spatial frequency, drifting at the same rate in the opposite direction. Additionally, S is microbalanced if the result WS of windowing S by any space-time-separable function W is drift balanced. We prove that (i) any space-time-separable random (or nonrandom) stimulus is microbalanced; (ii) any linear combination of pairwise independent microbalanced (respectively, drift-balanced) random stimuli is microbalanced and drift balanced if the expectation of each component is uniformly zero; (iii) the convolution of independent microbalanced and drift-balanced random stimuli is microbalanced and drift balanced; (iv) the product of independent microbalanced random stimuli is microbalanced; and (v) the expected response of any Reichardt detector to any microbalanced random stimulus is zero at every instant in time. Examples are provided of classes of microbalanced random stimuli that display consistent and compelling motion in one direction. All the results and examples from the domain of motion perception are transposable to the space-domain problem of detecting orientation in a texture pattern.},

	Abstract = {Convergent physiological and behavioral evidence indicates that the initial receptive fields responsible for motion detection are spatially localized. Consequently, the perception of global patterns of movement (such as expansion) requires that the output of these local mechanisms be integrated across visual space. We have differentiated local and global motion processes, with mixtures of coherent and incoherent moving patterns composed of bandpass filtered dots, and have measured their spatial-frequency selectivity. We report that local motion detectors show narrow-band spatial-frequency tuning (i.e., they respond only to a narrow range of spatial frequencies) but that global motion detectors show broadband spatial-frequency tuning (i.e., they integrate across a broad range of spatial frequencies), with a preference for low spatial frequencies.},

@article{Zanker:2001vn,
	Abstract = {Motion-defined motion can play a special role in the discussion of whether one or two separate systems are required to process first- and second-order information because, in contrast to other second-order stimuli, such as contrast-modulated contours, motion detection cannot be explained by a simple input nonlinearity but requires preprocessing by motion detectors. Furthermore, the perceptual quality that defines an object (motion on the object surface) is identical to that which is attributed to the object as an emergent feature (motion of the object), raising the question of how these two object properties are linked. The interaction of first- and second-order information in such stimuli has been analyzed previously in a direction-discrimination task, revealing some cooperativity. Because any comprehensive integration of these two types of motion information should be reflected in the most fundamental property of a moving object, i.e., the direction in which it moves, we now investigate how motion direction is estimated in motion-defined objects. Observers had to report the direction of moving objects that were defined by luminance contrast or in random-dot kinematograms by differences in the spatiotemporal properties between the object region and the random-noise background. When the dots were moving coherently with the object (Fourier motion), direction sensitivity resembled that for luminance-defined objects, but performance deteriorated when the dots in the object region were static (drift-balanced motion). When the dots on the object surface were moving diagonally relative to the object direction (theta motion), the general level of accuracy declined further, and the perceived direction was intermediate between the veridical object motion direction and the direction of dot motion, indicating that the first- and second-order velocity vectors are somehow pooled. The inability to separate first- and second-order directional information suggests that the two corresponding subsystems of motion processing are not producing independent percepts and provides clues for possible implementations of the two-layer motion-processing network.},

@article{Zanker:1993uq,
	Abstract = {Apparent motion stimuli of increasing complexity have been applied to analyse the mechanisms underlying visual motion perception. In the present paper it is investigated how motion detectors respond to three classes of stimuli which are realized as random-dot kinematograms. (i) In the most conventional stimuli, Fourier motion, a group of dots is displaced coherently in a random-dot pattern. (ii) In drift-balanced motion stimuli a bar made of static random dots is shifted in front of another random-dot pattern. (iii) In the novel class of stimuli, theta motion, an object which is exclusively defined by dot motion into one direction, is moving itself into the opposite direction. It is shown in psychophysical experiments that human observers perceive the direction of object motion in all three classes of stimuli. Simple motion detectors, however, only extract the motion direction of the object in the case of Fourier stimuli, and in the case of drift-balanced stimuli, if a nonlinear preprocessing is assumed. Any of the model alternatives discussed so far just detects the moving dots but not the object in a theta-stimulus, as is illustrated by a combinatorial analysis using a simplified version of a motion detector of the correlation type, which operates on a discrete time scale and takes only discrete values. In order to account for the detection of theta-motion, a model consisting of two hierarchical layers of motion detectors is developed, and simulated for conditions as used in the psychophysical experiments. The perception of theta-motion and the two-layer model is discussed in relation to psychophysical data and theoretical considerations from the literature, to try to incorporate the proposed two-layer model into a general scheme of visual motion processing.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) filter attend targets distinctly from distracters through their response rates. The extent to which this ability correlates with the organism's performance, and the neural processes underlying it, remain unclear. We trained monkeys to attend to a visual target that differed in rank along a color-ordinal scale from that of a distracter. The animals' performance at focusing attention on the target and filtering out the distracter improved as ordinal distance between the stimuli increased. Importantly, dlPFC neurons also improved their filtering performance with increasing ordinal target-distracter distance; they built up their response rate in anticipation of the target-distracter onset, and then units encoding target representations increased their firing rate by similar amounts, whereas units encoding distracter representations gradually suppressed their rates as the interstimulus ordinal distance increased. These results suggest that attentional-filtering performance in primates relies upon dlPFC neurons' ability to suppress distracter representations.},

@article{Price:2010ys,
	Abstract = {The contribution of sensory neurons to perceptual decisions about external stimulus events has received much attention, but it is less clear how sensory responses are integrated over time to produce decisions that are both rapid and reliable. To address this issue, we recorded from middle temporal area and medial superior temporal area neurons in rhesus macaques performing a task requiring the detection and discrimination of unpredictable speed changes. We examined how neuronal activity encoded the sign of the speed change and predicted the animals' behavioral judgments and reaction times, with a focus on the timescales over which neuronal activity is informative. False detection trials, on which animals reported a speed change even though none had occurred, were grouped according to the animals' discrimination judgment. By comparing the neuronal responses between the two groups of false detection trials, we were able to predict the animals' choices from the sensory activity of single neurons at levels significantly better than chance. These choice probability measurements were strongest using spike counts in an 80 ms window ending 150 ms before a choice saccade began, but significant choice probabilities were observed in windows as short as 10 ms. While the maximum deviation in spiking rate following a speed change is evident in the transient response, averaging neuronal activity in longer time windows can be more informative about both the stimulus and the animals' behavioral judgments. Thus the timescales found in this study represent a trade-off between producing rapid reactions and overcoming the noise inherent in short time windows.},

	Abstract = {Object recognition is a central function of the visual system. As a first step, the features of an object are registered; these independently encoded features are then bound together to form a single representation. Here we investigate the locus of this "feature integration" by examining crowding, a striking breakdown of this process. Crowding, an inability to identify a peripheral target surrounded by flankers, results from "excessive integration" of target and flanker features. We presented a standard crowding display with a target C flanked by four flanker C's in the periphery. We then masked only the flankers (but not the target) with one of three kinds of masks-noise, metacontrast, and object substitution-each of which interferes at progressively higher levels of visual processing. With noise and metacontrast masks (low-level masking), the crowded target was recovered, whereas with object substitution masks (high-level masking), it was not. This places a clear upper bound on the locus of interference in crowding suggesting that crowding is not a low-level phenomenon. We conclude that feature integration, which underlies crowding, occurs prior to the locus of object substitution masking. Further, our results indicate that the integrity of the flankers, but not their identification, is crucial for crowding to occur.},

@article{Pylyshyn:1988fk,
	Abstract = {There is considerable evidence that visual attention is concentrated at a single locus in the visual field, and that this locus can be moved independent of eye movements. Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40\% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87\% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition.},

	Abstract = {
Attention can enhance selectively the visual information processing of particular locations or objects. Recent studies have shown that this enhancement has limited spatial resolution, the smallest regions that can be isolated by attention are much coarser than the smallest details that can be resolved by vision. Multiple similar objects spaced more finely than the limit of attentional resolution cannot be individuated for further processing and can only be perceived as a grouped texture. As a result, at any given time, only part of the spatial and temporal information registered by the early sensory systems is available to conscious perception. It is likely that attentional resolution is limited at a stage beyond V1 and that it has a finer grain in the lower visual field than in the upper field. The spatial aperture of attention is elongated along the radial axis relative to fixation. The briefest temporal window of attention is also much broader than visual temporal resolution. Many perceptual phenomena related to rapid serial visual presentation may reflect the limited temporal resolution of attention.},

	Abstract = {Visual spatial resolution is limited by factors ranging from optics to neuronal filters in the visual cortex, but it is not known to what extent it is also limited by the resolving power of attention. To investigate this, we studied adaptation to lines of specific orientation, a process that occurs in primary visual cortex. When a single grating is presented in the periphery of the visual field, human observers are aware of its orientation, but when it is flanked by other similar gratings ('crowding'), its orientation becomes impossible to discern. Nevertheless, we show that orientation-specific adaptation is not affected by crowding, implying that spatial resolution is limited by an attentional filter acting beyond the primary visual cortex. Consistent with this, we find that attentional resolution is greater in the lower than in the upper visual field, whereas there is no corresponding asymmetry in the primary visual cortex. We suggest that the attentional filter acts in one or more higher visual cortical areas to restrict the availability of visual information to conscious awareness.},

	Abstract = {Identifying a target is more difficult when distracters are present within a zone of interaction around the target. We investigated whether the spatial extent of the zone of interaction scales with the size of the target. Our target was a letter T in one-of-four orientations. Our distracters were four squared-thetas in one-of-two orientations, presented one in each of the four cardinal directions, equidistant from the target. Target-distracter separation was varied and the proportion of correct responses at each separation was determined. From these the extent of interaction was estimated. This procedure was repeated for different target sizes spread over a 5-fold range. In each case, the contrast of the target was adjusted so that its visibility was constant across target sizes. The experiment was performed in the luminance domain (grey targets on grey background) and in the chromatic domain (green target on equiluminant grey background). In the luminance domain, target size had only a small effect on the extent of interaction; these interactions did not scale with target size. The extents of interaction for chromatic stimuli were similar to those for luminance stimuli. For a fixed target visibility, decreasing the duration of the stimulus resulted in an increase in the extent of interaction. The relevance of our findings is discussed with regard to a variety of proposed explanations for crowding. Our results are consistent with an attention-based explanation for crowding.},

@article{Seiffert:1998uq,
	Abstract = {Motion detection can be achieved either with mechanisms sensitive to a target's velocity, or sensitive to change in a target's position. Using a procedure to dissociate these two provided by Nakayama and Tyler (Vis Res 1981;21:427-433), we explored detection of first-order (luminance-based) and various second-order (texture-based and stereo-based) motion. In the first experiment, observers viewed annular gratings oscillating in rotational motion at various rates. For each oscillation temporal frequency, we determined the minimum displacement of the pattern for which observers could reliably see motion. For first-order motion, these motion detection thresholds decreased with increasing temporal frequency, and thus were determined by a minimum velocity. In contrast, motion detection thresholds for second-order motion remained roughly constant across temporal frequency, and thus were determined by a minimum displacement. In Experiment 2, luminance-based gratings of different contrasts were tested to show that the velocity-dependence was not an artifact of pattern visibility. In the remaining experiments, results similar to Experiment 1 were obtained with a central presentation of a linear grating, instead of an annular grating (Experiment 3), and with a motion discrimination (phase discrimination) rather than motion detection task (Experiment 4). We conclude that, within the ranges tested here, second-order motion is more readily detected with a mechanism which tracks the change of position of features over time.},

	Abstract = {Object tokens are episodic visual representations that mediate the ability to track visual events as they move about and change over time. Multiple tokens also allow the viewer to individuate multiple instances of a single type of object. In the present study, we established a functional link for object tokens in two seemingly disparate visual phenomena: apparent motion and repetition blindness (RB). In RB, repeated items are more difficult to perceive than unrepeated items. Using displays in which two sets of alphanumeric characters streamed in opposite directions across a computer screen in apparent motion, we found increased RBfor targets appearing within a single apparent motion stream, relative to targets in different apparent motion streams. The results are inconsistent with refractory period or memory retrieval accounts of RB and support the role of object tokens in both apparent motion and RB.},

	Abstract = {Voluntary attention is the top-down selection process that focuses cortical processing resources on the most relevant sensory information. Spatial attention--that is, selection based on stimulus position--alters neuronal responsiveness throughout primate visual cortex. It has been hypothesized that it also changes receptive field profiles by shifting their centers toward attended locations and by shrinking them around attended stimuli. Here we examined, at high resolution, receptive fields in cortical area MT of rhesus macaque monkeys when their attention was directed to different locations within and outside these receptive fields. We found a shift of receptive fields, even far from the current location of attention, accompanied by a small amount of shrinkage. Thus, already in early extrastriate cortex, receptive fields are not static entities but are highly modifiable, enabling the dynamic allocation of processing resources to attended locations and supporting enhanced perception within the focus of attention by effectively increasing the local cortical magnification.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments investigated whether the repeated-letter inferiority effect (RLIE) and repetition blindness (RB) are identical phenomena or not and how the RLIE can be reconciled with the flanker compatibility effect (FCE). Participants reported a masked target and ignored an unmasked distractor. We manipulated the type of distractor (identical, alternative target, or neutral), the order of presenting distractor and target, and the predictability of target location. When distractors preceded the targets, distractors identical to the target always caused deficits in target processing (i.e., RB). With simultaneous presentation, identical distractors caused deficits (i.e., an RLIE) for unpredictable target locations only. Yet the RLIE was significantly smaller than RB. This result suggests that simultaneously presented stimuli are identified serially, in random order, if target position is unpredictable. As a result, RB arises only in the 50\% of all trials with identical distractors in which the distractor is identified before the target. With simultaneous presentation and predictable target location, however, parallel processing of targets and distractors was possible that gave rise to an FCE in recognition accuracy. Analyses of false alarm rates revealed no evidence of significant response biases.},

@article{Ferrera:2010ly,
	Abstract = {An internal model for predictive saccades in frontal cortex was investigated by recording neurons in monkey frontal eye field (FEF) during an inferred motion task. Monkeys were trained to make saccades to the extrapolated position of a small moving target that was rendered temporarily invisible and whose trajectory was altered. On approximately two-thirds of the trials, monkeys made multiple saccades while the target was invisible. Primary saccades were correlated with extrapolated target position. Secondary saccades significantly reduced residual errors resulting from imperfect accuracy of the first saccade. These observations suggest that the second saccade was corrective. Because there was no visual feedback, corrective saccades could only be driven by an internally generated error signal. Neuronal activity in the frontal eye field was directionally tuned before both primary and secondary saccades. Separate subpopulations of cells encoded either saccade direction or direction error before the second saccade. These results suggest that FEF neurons encode the error after the first saccade, as well as the direction of the second saccade. Hence, FEF appears to contribute to detecting and correcting movement errors based on internally generated signals.},

	Abstract = {Visual signals generated by self-motion are initially represented in retinal coordinates in the early parts of the visual system. Since this information can be used by an observer to navigate through the environment, it must be transformed into body or world coordinates at later stations of the visual-motor pathway. Neurons in the dorsal aspect of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) are tuned to the focus of expansion (FOE) of the visual image. We performed experiments to determine whether focus tuning curves in area MSTd are represented in eye coordinates or in screen coordinates (which could be head, body, or world centered in the head-fixed paradigm used). Since MSTd neurons adjust their FOE tuning curves during pursuit eye movements to compensate for changes in pursuit and translation speed that distort the visual image, the coordinate frame was determined while the eyes were stationary (fixed gaze, simulated pursuit condition) and while the eyes were moving (real pursuit condition). We recorded extracellular responses from 80 MSTd neurons in two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We found that the FOE tuning curves of the overwhelming majority of neurons were aligned in an eye-centered coordinate frame in each of the experimental conditions (fixed gaze: 77/80 (96\%); real pursuit: 77/80 (96\%); simulated pursuit 74/80 (93\%); t-test, p<0.05). These results indicate that MSTd neurons represent heading in an eye-centered coordinate frame both when the eyes are stationary and when they are moving. We also found that area MSTd demonstrates significant eye position gain modulation of response fields much like its posterior parietal neighbors.},

	Abstract = {Humans use smooth pursuit eye movements to track moving objects of interest. In order to track an object accurately, motion signals from the target have to be integrated and segmented from motion signals in the visual context. Most studies on pursuit eye movements used small visual targets against a featureless background, disregarding the requirements of our natural visual environment. Here, we tested the ability of the pursuit and the perceptual system to integrate motion signals across larger areas of the visual field. Stimuli were random-dot kinematograms (RDK) containing a horizontal motion signal, which was perturbed by a spatially localized, peripheral motion signal. Perturbations appeared in a gaze-contingent coordinate system and had a different direction than the main motion including a vertical component. We measured ocular and perceptual direction discrimination decisions and found that both steady-state pursuit and perception were influenced most by perturbation angles close to that of the main motion signal and only in regions close to the center of gaze. The narrow direction bandwidth (26 deg full width at half height) and small spatial extent (8 deg standard deviation) correspond closely to tuning parameters of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT).},

	Abstract = {Statistical decision theory (SDT) and Bayesian decision theory (BDT) are closely related mathematical frameworks used to model ideal performance in a wide range of visual and motor tasks. Their elements (gain function, likelihood, prior) are readily interpretable in terms of information available to the observer. We briefly describe SDT and BDT and then review recent work employing them as models of biological perception or action. We emphasize work that employs gain functions and priors as independent or dependent variables. At one extreme, Bayesian decision theory allows the experimenter to compute ideal performance in specific tasks and compare human performance to ideal (Geisler, 1989). No claim is made that visual processing is in any sense "Bayesian". At the other extreme, researchers have proposed Bayesian decision theory as a process model of "perception as Bayesian inference" (Knill \& Richards, 1996). We end by discussing how possible ideal models are related to imperfect, actual observers and how the "Bayesian hypothesis" can be tested experimentally.},

	Abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with 
inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the 
rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful 
forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but 
rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We 
examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial 
aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian 
confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating 
and also on our experience of applied work in social science. 
Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also 
statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and 
compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged 
practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their frame- 
work. },

	Abstract = {1. The dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MST) is characterized by clusters of three types of visually responsive cells: Direction cells, which respond to a straight frontoparallel movement in a particular direction; Expansion/contraction cells, which selectively respond to either an expansion or contraction; and Rotation cells, which selectively respond to either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. To study their functional role, experiments were carried out on immobilized monkeys, anesthetized with N2O. 2. The areal extent of stimulation was crucial for activation: movements of a pattern extending over a wide visual field elicited a larger response than those elicited by a local pattern. 3. The shape, exact size, and sign of contrast of the texture components of the pattern were not important in determining the magnitude of response. 4. Different cells responded to different ranges of speed of movement. 5. Expansion/contraction cells were activated more strongly by a real (isotropic) expansion/contraction than by an "axial expansion/contraction" in which a pattern expanded or contracted along a particular axis. Rotation cells were activated more strongly by a circular rotation in the frontoparallel plane than by a shearing movement. 6. We discuss the possibility that the cells are involved in the detection and analysis of wide-field movements, which are generally caused by a movement of the animal itself. The mode (straight transfer, expansion/contraction, or rotation), direction, and speed of the relative movement of the animal and the external space may be represented by the activity of the cells.},

@article{Newsome:1986ys,
	Abstract = {We have conducted physiological and psychophysical experiments to identify possible neural substrates of the perception of apparent motion. We used identical sequences of flashed stimuli in both sets of experiments to better compare the responses of cortical neurons and psychophysical observers. Physiological data were obtained from two cortical visual areas, striate cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (MT). In the previous paper we presented evidence that neuronal thresholds for direction selectivity in extrastriate area MT were similar to psychophysical thresholds for motion perception at the largest effective interflash interval, and thus speed, for a given eccentricity. We now examine physiological and psychophysical thresholds for a broad range of speeds to determine whether such a correspondence exists for speeds below the upper threshold considered in the previous paper. Stimuli were presented in stroboscopic motion of constant apparent speed while the spatial and temporal interflash intervals were systematically varied. For each neuron we measured the largest spatial interval that elicited directionally selective responses at each of several apparent speeds. We calculated the composite performance of neurons in both MT and V1 by averaging the spatial interval necessary for direction selectivity at each apparent speed. We employed the same apparent-motion stimuli for psychophysical experiments with human subjects in which we measured the spatial interval necessary for the perception of motion over a similar range of apparent speeds. We obtained a composite profile of psychophysical performance by averaging thresholds across subjects at each apparent speed. For high apparent speeds, physiological data from MT, but not V1, corresponded closely to the psychophysical data as suggested in the preceding paper. For low apparent speeds, however, physiological data from MT and V1 were similar to each other and to the psychophysical data. It would appear, therefore, that neurons in either V1 or MT could mediate the perceptual effect at low speeds, whereas MT is a stronger candidate for this role at high speeds. We suggest that the neuronal substrate for apparent motion may be distributed over multiple cortical areas, depending upon the speed and spatial interval of the stimulus.},

@article{Mikami:1986vn,
	Abstract = {We measured the spatial and temporal limits of directional interactions for 105 directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons and 26 directionally selective striate (V1) neurons. Directional interactions were measured using sequentially flashed stimuli in which the spatial and temporal intervals between stimuli were systematically varied over a broad range. A direction index was employed to determine the strength of directional interactions for each combination of spatial and temporal intervals tested. The maximum spatial interval for which directional interactions occurred in a particular neuron was positively correlated with receptive-field size and with retinal eccentricity in both MT and V1. The maximum spatial interval was, on average, three times as large in MT as in V1. The maximum temporal interval for which we obtained directional interactions was similar in MT and V1 and did not vary with receptive-field size or eccentricity. The maximum spatial interval for directional interactions as measured with flashed stimuli was positively correlated with the maximum speed of smooth motion that yielded directional responses. MT neurons were directionally selective for higher speeds than were V1 neurons. These observations indicate that the large receptive fields found in MT permit directional interactions over longer distances than do the more limited receptive fields of V1 neurons. A functional advantage is thereby conferred on MT neurons because they detect directional differences for higher speeds than do V1 neurons. Recent psychophysical studies have measured the spatial and temporal limits for the perception of apparent motion in sequentially flashed visual displays. A comparison of the psychophysical results with our physiological data indicates that the spatiotemporal limits for perception are similar to the limits for direction selectivity in MT neurons but differ markedly from those for V1 neurons. These observations suggest a correspondence between neuronal responses in MT and the short-range process of apparent motion.},

	Abstract = {Mechanisms of direction selectivity and speed selectivity were studied in single neurons of the middle temporal visual area (MT) of behaving macaque monkeys. Visual stimuli were presented in both smooth and stroboscopic motion within a neuron's receptive field as the monkey fixated a stationary point of light. Direction selectivity, speed selectivity, and the spontaneous discharge characteristics of MT neurons in behaving monkeys were similar to those reported in previous studies in anesthetized monkeys. Stroboscopic motion stimuli were sequences of flashes characterized by the spatial and temporal intervals between each flash. The spatial and temporal intervals were systematically varied so that suppressive and facilitatory interactions could be studied in both the preferred and null directions. Suppression and facilitation were measured by subtracting the peak discharge rate elicited by a single flash from the peak discharge rate elicited by a stroboscopic train of flashes. The dominant mechanism of direction selectivity in MT was a pronounced suppression of discharge for motion in the null direction which we interpreted as inhibition. The inhibition was sufficiently potent to abolish the responses to single flashed stimuli when they were embedded in a series of flashes in the null direction, and it frequently reduced the neuronal discharge to a level below the spontaneous firing rate. Facilitation in the preferred direction was a prominent feature of the responses of some, but not all, MT neurons. The peak discharge rate for stroboscopic motion in the preferred direction was more than twice the peak rate to a single flash for approximately 50\% of the neurons in our sample. The direction selectivity of most MT neurons showed the effects of both inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms, and it was not possible to segregate MT neurons into distinct groups on the basis of these measures. Suppressive mechanisms contributed to speed tuning as well as direction tuning. The low-speed cutoff for motion in the preferred direction resulted from suppression in 82\% of the neurons tested. The high-speed cutoff resulted from suppression in 32\% of the neurons tested. The latter mechanism appeared to be distinct from the inhibitory mechanism which acted in the null direction in that large spatial intervals were required for its activation.},

	Abstract = {Cortical maps and feedback connections are ubiquitous features of the visual cerebral cortex. The role of the feedback connections, however, is unclear. This study was aimed at revealing possible organizational relationships between the feedback projections from area V2 and the functional maps of orientation and retinotopy in area V1. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was combined with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and connectional anatomy in owl monkeys. Tracer injections were administered at orientation-selective domains in regions of pale and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes adjacent to the border between these stripes. The feedback projections from V2 were found to be more diffuse than the intrinsic horizontal connections within V1, but they nevertheless demonstrated clustering. The clusters of feedback axons projected preferentially to interblob cytochrome oxidase regions. The distribution of preferred orientations of the recipient domains in V1 was broad but appeared biased toward values similar to the preferred orientation of the projecting cells in V2. The global spatial distribution of the feedback projections in V1 was anisotropic. The major axis of anisotropy was systematically parallel to a retinotopic axis in V1 corresponding to the preferred orientation of the cells of origin in V2. We conclude that the feedback connections from V2 to V1 might play a role in enhancing the response in V1 to collinear contour elements.},

@article{Priebe:2006kx,
	Abstract = {We recorded the responses of direction-selective simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. When studied with sine-wave gratings, almost all simple cells in V1 had responses that were separable for spatial and temporal frequency: the preferred temporal frequency did not change and preferred speed decreased as a function of the spatial frequency of the grating. As in previous recordings from the middle temporal visual area (MT), approximately one-quarter of V1 complex cells had separable responses to spatial and temporal frequency, and one-quarter were "speed tuned" in the sense that preferred speed did not change as a function of spatial frequency. Half fell between these two extremes. Reducing the contrast of the gratings caused the population of V1 complex cells to become more separable in their tuning for spatial and temporal frequency. Contrast dependence is explained by the contrast gain of the neurons, which was relatively higher for gratings that were either both of high or both of low temporal and spatial frequency. For stimuli that comprised two spatially superimposed sine-wave gratings, the preferred speeds and tuning bandwidths of V1 neurons could be predicted from the sum of the responses to the component gratings presented alone, unlike neurons in MT that showed nonlinear interactions. We conclude that spatiotemporal modulation of contrast gain creates speed tuning from separable inputs in V1 complex cells. Speed tuning in MT could be primarily inherited from V1, but processing that occurs after V1 and possibly within MT computes selective combinations of speed-tuned signals of special relevance for downstream perceptual and motor mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Decisions about sensory stimuli are often based on an accumulation of evidence in time. When subjects control stimulus duration, the decision terminates when the accumulated evidence reaches a criterion level. Under many natural circumstances and in many laboratory settings, the environment, rather than the subject, controls the stimulus duration. In these settings, it is generally assumed that subjects commit to a choice at the end of the stimulus stream. Indeed, failure to benefit from the full stream of information is interpreted as a sign of imperfect accumulation or memory leak. Contrary to these assumptions, we show that monkeys performing a direction discrimination task commit to a choice when the accumulated evidence reaches a threshold level (or bound), sometimes long before the end of stimulus. This bounded accumulation of evidence is reflected in the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex. Thus, the readout of visual cortex embraces a termination rule to limit processing even when potentially useful information is available.},

	Abstract = {Sensitivity to visual motion is a fundamental property of neurons in the visual cortex and has received wide attention in terms of mathematical models. A key feature of many popular models for cortical motion sensors is the use of pairs of functions that are related by a 90 degrees phase shift. This phase relationship, known as quadrature, is the hallmark of the motion energy model and played an important role in the development of a class of model dubbed elaborated Reichardt detectors. For decades, the literature has supported a link between quadrature and the observation that motion detectors and human observers often prefer a 1/4 cycle displacement of an apparent motion stimulus that consists of a pair of sinusoidal gratings. We show that there is essentially no link between quadrature and this preference. Quadrature is neither necessary nor sufficient for a motion sensor to prefer 1/4 cycle displacement, and motion energy is not maximized for a 1/4 cycle step. Other properties of motion sensors are the key: the opponent subtraction of two oppositely tuned stages that individually have sinusoidal displacement tuning curves. Thus, psychophysical and neurophysiological data revealing a preference at or near 1/4 cycle displacement do not offer specific support for common quadrature or energy-based motion models. Instead, they point to a broader class of model.},

	Abstract = {Visual processing shows a highly distributed organization in which the presentation of a visual stimulus simultaneously activates neurons in multiple columns across several cortical areas. It has been suggested that precise spatiotemporal activity patterns within and across cortical areas play a key role in higher cognitive, motor, and visual functions. In the visual system, these patterns have been proposed to take part in binding stimulus features into a coherent object, i.e., to be involved in perceptual grouping. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in behaving monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, males), we simultaneously measured neural population activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate cortex (V2, V4) at high spatial and temporal resolution. We detected time point population events (PEs) in the VSDI signal of each pixel and found that they reflect transient increased neural activation within local populations by establishing their relation to spiking and local field potential activity. Then, we searched for repeating space and time relations between the detected PEs. We demonstrate the following: (1) spatiotemporal patterns occurring within (horizontal) and across (vertical) early visual areas repeat significantly above chance level; (2) information carried in only a few patterns can be used to reliably discriminate between stimulus categories on a single-trial level; (3) the spatiotemporal patterns yielding high classification performance are characterized by late temporal occurrence and top-down propagation, which are consistent with cortical mechanisms involving perceptual grouping. The pattern characteristics and the robust relation between the patterns and the stimulus categories suggest that spatiotemporal activity patterns play an important role in cortical mechanisms of higher visual processing.},

	Abstract = {Visual cortex shows smooth retinotopic organization on the macroscopic scale, but it is unknown how receptive fields are organized at the level of neighboring neurons. This information is crucial for discriminating among models of visual cortex. We used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to independently map ON and OFF receptive field subregions of local populations of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse visual cortex. Receptive field subregions were often precisely shared among neighboring neurons. Furthermore, large subregions seem to be assembled from multiple smaller, non-overlapping subregions of other neurons in the same local population. These experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of the diversity of receptive fields in a dense local network of visual cortex and reveal elementary units of receptive field organization. Our results suggest that a limited pool of afferent receptive fields is available to a local population of neurons and reveal new organizational principles for the neural circuitry of the mouse visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {We are normally not aware of the microscopic eye movements that keep the retinal image in motion during visual fixation. In principle, perceptual cancellation of the displacements of the retinal stimulus caused by fixational eye movements could be achieved either by means of motor/proprioceptive information or by inferring eye movements directly from the retinal stimulus. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying visual stability during ocular drift, the primary source of retinal image motion during fixation on a stationary scene. By using an accurate system for gaze-contingent display control, we decoupled the eye movements of human observers from the changes in visual input that they normally cause. We show that the visual system relies on the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina, rather than on extraretinal information, to discard the motion signals resulting from ocular drift. These results have important implications for the establishment of stable visual representations in the brain and argue that failure to visually determine eye drift contributes to well known motion illusions such as autokinesis and induced movement.},

@article{Rovamo:1979nq,
	Abstract = {Comparisons of the published data on the density D of receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells and on the cortical magnification factor M indicated that M2 is directly proportional to D in primates. Therefore, the human M can be estimated for the principal meridians of the visual field from the density-distribution of retinal ganglion cells and from the density of the centralmost cones. Using the previously published empirical data, we estimated the values of the human M and express the values in four simple equations that can be used for finding the value of M for any location of the visual field. The monocular values of M are not radially symmetric. These analytically expressed values of M make it possible to predict contrast sensitivity and resolution for any location of the visual field. We measured contrast sensitivity functions at 25 different locations and found that the functions could be made similar by scaling the retinal dimensions of test gratings by the inverse values of M. Visual acuity and resolution could be predicted accurately for all retinal locations by means of a single constant multiplier of the estimated M. The results indicate that the functional and structural properties of the visual system are very closely and similarly related across the whole retina. Visual acuity, e.g., bears the same optimal relation to the density of sampling executed by retinal ganglion cells at all locations of the visual fields.},

@article{Virsu:1979pq,
	Abstract = {This study shows that photopic contrast sensitivity and resolution can be predicted by means of simple functions derived by using the cortical magnification factor M as a scale factor of mapping from the visual field into the striate cortex. We measured the minimum contrast required for discriminating the direction of movement or orientation of sinusoidal gratings, or for detecting them in central and peripheral vision. No qualitative differences were found between central and peripheral vision, and almost all quantitative differences observed could be removed by means of a size compensation derived from M. The results indicated specifically that (1) visual patterns can be made equally visible if they are scaled so that their calculated cortical representations become equivalent; (2) contrast sensitivity follows the same power function of the cortical area stimulated by a grating at any eccentricity; (3) area and squared spatial frequency are reciprocally related as determinants of contrast sensitivity; and (4) acuity and resolution are directly proportional to M, and the minimum angle of resolution is directly proportional to M-1. The power law of spatial summation expressed in (2) and (3) suggests the existence of a central integrator that pools the activity of cortical neurons. This summation mechanism makes the number of potentially activated visual cells the most important determinant of visibility and contrast sensitivity. The functional homogeneity of image processing across the visual field observed here agrees with the assumed anatomical and physiological uniformity of the visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {This review covers a period bracketed by two OSA Symposia--"Vision under Stabilized Image Conditions," held in San Francisco in 1978, and "Motion and Vision in Man and Machine," held in New Orleans in 1983--during which image stabilization came of age as a standard technique of visual psychophysics. It seems clear that the first spatiotemporal signal-processing step in the visual system depends on image motion; e.g., a constant velocity effectively provides the mathematical convolution of stimulus patterns with retinal receptive fields. Thus the motion of the stimulus pattern at the retina is an important experimental variable over which we have only recently gained full control. We can now replace the haphazard behavior of the subject's natural eye movements by simpler forms of motion that are known and controlled by the experimenter. Results obtained in our laboratory with such stabilized fixation control include threshold measurements for moving lines and gratings, comparison of contrast sensitivities with natural and artificial eye movements, effects of orientation on moving-grating thresholds, models of the stabilized spatiotemporal threshold surface, and effects of retinal inhomogeneity on selectivity for spatial frequency and velocity. Other experiments, too numerous to include here, have also used these techniques.},

@article{Kelly:1982lh,
	Abstract = {When the thresholds for periodic spatial patterns containing two or more differently oriented components (e.g., crossed gratings) are measured under normal, unstabilized conditions, each component seems to be detected almost independently of the others if their angular orientations are sufficiently different. This psychophysical behavior has been attributed to anisotropic or orientation-tuned units in the visual cortex. Here we report that when the image of such a multicomponent pattern is stabilized on the retina, the independent-detection behavior vanishes. Under stabilized-image conditions, the contrast sensitivity is governed by the maximum local contrast at the retina. The number and relative contrast of individual components, even orthogonal ones, behave almost additively in making up the threshold contrast. We confirmed this conclusion with a variety of patterns that give orientation-tuning effects in unstabilized viewing. Controlled image motion (resembling the effect  of the natural drifts of the eye) restores the independent-detection behavior in every case, as do other forms of temporal modulation (e.g., flicker or flash presentations). We infer (1) that orientation-tuned units in man do not respond to unchanging stimuli--they cannot function unless the pattern on the retina is temporally modulated, and (2) in the absence of temporal modulation, spatial patterns are detected by isotropic units of relatively low sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {It has been suggested that local variations of retinal sensitivity may be responsible for elevating the threshold in pattern-adaptation experiments of the Blakemore-Campbell type. Subjects are unable to scan high-contrast gratings uniformly enough to eliminate this possibility. To control this effect, we performed grating-adaptation experiments under stabilized-image conditions, while both adapting and test targets were moved at retinal velocities determined by the experimenter. By means of an afterimage technique, we also measured the strength of the retinal sensitivity mask that forms under these conditions. Varying the spatial frequency and velocity of the adapting stimulus, we inferred the spatial and temporal properties of the principal mechanism that contributes to the afterimage. We found that the Blakemore-Campbell effect persists at adapting velocities that are fast enough to rule out local variations of retinal sensitivity. More surprisingly, even the clearly visible afterimages that occur at a retinal velocity of 0.1 deg/s seem to have no effect on pattern adaptation. (Sensitivity masking can raise the adapted threshold, but only at adapting velocities slower than normal eye movements). By manipulating the image velocity, we were able to shift the spatial frequencies of some threshold-elevation curves, but these shifts were not great enough to suggest that velocity tuning plays important role in pattern adaptation.},

	Abstract = {The stabilized contrast-sensitivity function measured at a constant retinal velocity is tuned to a particular spatial frequency, which is inversely related to the velocity chosen. The Fourier transforms of these constant-velocity passbands have the same form as retinal receptive fields of various sizes. At low velocities, in the range of the natural drift motions of the eye, the stabilized contrast-sensitivity function matches the normal, unstablized result. At higher velocities (corresponding to motions of objects in the environment), this curve maintains the same shape but shifts toward lower spatial frequencies. The constant-velocity passband is displaced across the spatio-temporal frequency domain in a manner that is almost symmetric about the constant-velocity plane at v = 2 deg/s. Interpolating these diagonal profiles by a suitable analytic expression, we construct the spatio-temporal threshold surface for stabilized vision, and display its properties in terms of the usual frequency parameters; e.g., at low spatial frequencies, the temporal response becomes nearly independent of spatial frequency, while at low temporal frequencies, the spatial response becomes independent of temporal frequency.},

Calibration of this compensatory motion is very critical; a gain error greater than 1\% may produce significant destablization. Under optimum conditions, image stabilization elevates the subject's contrast threshold by a factor of about 20; it also produces after-images with resolution greater than 12 c/deg. These results compare favorably with those obtained by other methods.},

	Abstract = {We asked the question "is the visual field temporally homogeneous when the well known spatial inhomogeneity is taken into account?" Our results show that the visual field exhibits inhomogeneity for stimuli of low spatial frequency for which the spatial inhomogeneity is minimal. This inhomogeneity takes the form of a reduction in sensitivity for stimuli of low temporal frequency in the periphery and an enhancement of sensitivity for stimuli of high temporal frequency in the periphery. The low temporal frequency loss in the periphery is post-receptoral and must involve a selective loss of sensitivity of the low pass filter. The enhanced high frequency sensitivity may be post-receptoral or purely receptoral. The consequence of such an inhomogeneity for subsequent stages of visual processing is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The apparent velocity of peripheral, drifting sinusoidal gratings was measured as a function of eccentricity and viewing distance. Gratings appeared to move more slowly in the periphery. Apparent velocities in fovea and periphery could be matched by an appropriate spatial scaling of peripheral gratings. This scaling factor provides a psychophysical measure of the changing spatial grain of the visual system with eccentricity. Scaling factors were found to be the same for lower threshold of motion and for velocity matching with standard gratings of 2 and 6 Hz. The finding generalised over a range of standard temporal frequencies (less than 7 Hz) and spatial frequencies (1.2-9 c/deg). The psychophysically determined scaling factors were found to be proportional to the square root of macaque mean cortical receptive field area as a function of eccentricity. The data support a ratio strategy for encoding motion in which motion information is expressed relative to the changing spatial grain of the visual system. Locations for the apparent identity of physically identical grating motion fell along a straight line in space, prompting an explanation of these visual field effects in terms of the acquisition of environmental information from optic flow.},

	Abstract = {Contrast sensitivity, measured as a function of retinal eccentricity for stimuli differing in temporal and spatial frequency (0.25-9 c/deg; 0-16 Hz, 0-12 degrees eccentricity), was maximum at the fovea and declined linearly with eccentricity. The slope of the decrease depended upon spatial but not temporal frequency. Contrast sensitivity for drifting gratings was approximately twice that for sinusoidal counterphase gratings at all eccentricities. For central viewing log contrast sensitivity increased with grating length. The shape of this function was systematically related to spatial frequency but independent of temporal frequency, indicating that the visual field is homogeneous in sensitivity for change in contrast over time. The implications of these findings for mechanisms of threshold vision in fovea and periphery are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We measured temporal and spatial contrast sensitivity functions of foveal and peripheral photopic vision at various locations in the nasal visual field. Sensitivity decreased monotonically with increasing eccentricity when it was measured by using the same test gratings at different eccentricities. When the gratings were normalized in area, spatial frequency, and translation velocity by means of the cortical magnification factor M so that the calculated cortical representations of the gratings became equivalent at different eccentricities, the temporal contrast sensitivity functions became similar at all eccentricities. The normalization was effective under all experimental conditions that included various kinds of temporal modulation from 0 to 25 Hz (movement, counterphase flicker and on-off flicker) and different threshold tasks (detection, orientation discrimination, and discrimination of movement direction), independently of the subjective appearances of the gratings at threshold. We conclude that central and peripheral vision are qualitatively similar in spatiotemporal visual performance. The quantitative differences observed without normalization seem to be caused by the spatial sampling properties of retinal ganglion cells that are directly related to the values of M used in the normalization.},

	Abstract = {This article describes further evidence for a new neural network theory of biological motion perception. The theory clarifies why parallel streams V1----V2, V1----MT, and V1----V2----MT exist for static form and motion form processing among the areas V1, V2, and MT of visual cortex. The theory suggests that the static form system (Static BCS) generates emergent boundary segmentations whose outputs are insensitive to direction-of-contrast and to direction-of-motion, whereas the motion form system (Motion BCS) generates emergent boundary segmentations whose outputs are insensitive to direction-of-contrast but sensitive to direction-of-motion. The theory is used to explain classical and recent data about short-range and long-range apparent motion percepts that have not yet been explained by alternative models. These data include beta motion, split motion, gamma motion and reverse-contrast gamma motion, delta motion, and visual inertia. Also included are the transition from group motion to element motion in response to a Ternus display as the interstimulus interval (ISI) decreases; group motion in response to a reverse-contrast Ternus display even at short ISIs; speed-up of motion velocity as interflash distance increases or flash duration decreases; dependence of the transition from element motion to group motion on stimulus duration and size, various classical dependencies between flash duration, spatial separation, ISI, and motion threshold known as Korte's laws; dependence of motion strength on stimulus orientation and spatial frequency; short-range and long-range form-color interactions; and binocular interactions of flashes to different eyes.},

	Abstract = {Our goal in this paper was to measure psychophysically the receptive-field size of motion units in human vision. To this aim, length and width spatial summation functions were measured for drifting (8-Hz) sinusoidal gratings of spatial frequencies 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 cycles per degree (c/deg) with two threshold criteria: direction discrimination and simple detection. For each spatial frequency, contrast sensitivity for detection of the direction of drift increased with increasing stimulus size (length or width), at first rapidly (slope greater than or equal to 1.0) and then more gradually (slope 0.29). For most stimuli, the detection and direction-discrimination contrast thresholds were nearly the same. However, for stimuli severely curtailed in width, significantly more contrast was required for direction discrimination than for detection. These results were predicted with a summation model, which incorporated three-dimensional (space-space-time) linear input filters, and probability summation over space and among different filter types. The fit of the model gave an estimate of both the receptive-field length and width of motion-detector units in human vision. At each spatial frequency, the estimates of receptive-field width and length were similar, indicating that the receptive fields of motion-detector units are as long as they are wide at all spatial scales. Receptive-field size varied from approximately 0.12 cycle at 0.1 c/deg to 0.52 cycle at 10.0 c/deg.},

	Abstract = {Thresholds for detecting the direction of motion of drifting (8-Hz) vertical gratings [of spatial frequencies 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 cycles per degree (c/deg)] were measured in the presence of masks that varied in both spatial frequency and orientation. Masks with different temporal properties were used. The specificity of masking was also measured for a stationary test grating of spatial frequency 3.0 c/deg. After suitable scaling and transformation, the masking data gave an estimate of the two-dimensional spatial-frequency tuning surface of cortical detector units in human vision. With the assumption of small-signal linearity and zero phase, the tuning surfaces were inverse Fourier transformed to give an indication of the size and structure of the psychophysical receptive fields of detector units. The results obtained with drifting test gratings and jittering (random phase) mask gratings indicate that motion-detector receptive fields increase in size (in cycles) with increasing spatial frequency but, at all spatial scales, have a length-width ratio of 1. These results are in close agreement with the summation results reported in J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 8, 1330 (1991). Using the same jittering mask stimuli and stationary test gratings, we confirm reports by Daugman [Vision Res. 24, 891 (1984)] and Harvey and Doan [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 7, 116 (1990)] that motion-independent units have elongated receptive fields with a length-width ratio near 1.8. We conclude that the receptive fields of motion-dependent and -independent mechanisms in human vision are fundamentally different. The possibility that the orientation selectivity of a motion unit is sharpened by its selectivity for direction of motion is discussed.},

We measured contrast sensitivity functions in human observers and calculated such functions in ideal observers for retinal eccentricities of 0-40 deg. Comparisons of human and ideal performance in a variety of tasks reveal that many aspects of the variation in spatial vision with eccentricity can be understood from an analysis of the discrimination information available at the retinal ganglion cells.},

	Abstract = {Receptive field sizes of motion detector units in the human visual system were determined using a summation technique. Contrast sensitivity was measured for detecting the direction of motion of a drifting (8 Hz) sinewave grating (0.01-30.0 c/deg) multiplied by a stationary Gaussian envelope, for various widths of the Gaussian envelope. For each test spatial frequency, sensitivity increased linearly with aperture width up to a certain limit, and thereafter at a rate consistent with a model incorporating probability summation over space and between channels. The limit of linear summation designates the limit of the receptive field. Results show that the receptive field size varies with spatial frequency, from 2' arc at high spatial frequencies to as large as 7 deg at low frequencies. The change in field size was progressive. The smallest aperture width (delta W) for directional discrimination was also measured. Results show delta W to vary from 0.03 cycles at low spatial frequencies to 0.30 cycles at high frequencies.},

@article{Anderson:1989nx,
	Abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the spatial frequency selectivity and spatial structure of receptive fields of motion sensitive mechanisms in human vision. Spatial frequency selectivity was inferred from masking measurements, using dynamic test and mask stimuli. For test frequencies between 0.025 and 15.0 c/deg, maximal masking occurred when the mask frequency matched that of the test, suggesting that the test was detected by mechanisms tuned to (or near to) that frequency. For tests below 0.025 c/deg or above 15.0 c/deg, maximal masking occurred at 0.025 and 15.0 c/deg, respectively, suggesting that there exist no mechanisms selective to frequencies outside these limits. A masking model, suitable for interpreting results obtained with drifting test stimuli, was developed and used to calculate spatial frequency selectivity functions from masking data. Assuming small signal linearity, and a constant phase spectrum, the selectivity functions were inverse-Fourier transformed to yield estimates of the extent and structure of receptive fields. Field width was found to vary with test spatial frequency from 5.8 deg at 0.03 c/deg to 0.05 deg at 10.0 c/deg. These estimates were compared with width estimates previously obtained by a summation technique (Anderson \& Burr, 1987), and found to be similar over a wide range of spatial frequencies (2.5 log units). Gabor functions provided a reasonable fit to the calculated field profiles at high spatial frequencies (above 1.0 c/deg), but not at low frequencies.},

The spastial, temporal and other constraints governing this effect are markedly different from those classically found for the apparent motion of isolated stimulus elements. The random-dot display appears to tap a low-level motion-detecting process, distinct from the more interpretive process elicited by the classical displays. The distinct contributions of these processes can be identified in 'multi-stable' displays which yield alternative percepts of apparent motion depending on which one or both of the processes is activated. Such experiments illustrate the interaction of relatively stimulus-constrained and relatively autonomous processes invisual perception.},

	Abstract = {Attending to a particular feature modulates the activity of neurons throughout the visual field with the result that relevant features are enhanced while irrelevant features are suppressed. Do these modulatory influences merely lead to a gating of relevant features, or does attention have a direct impact on the representation of feature space, leading to a different percept depending on the content of attention? We observed that direction estimates of the static motion aftereffect drastically change when human observers attend to a stimulus whose motion direction differs from the one of the adaptor. This observation suggests that feature-based attention might operate by local magnifications of feature space between relevant and irrelevant features.},

	Abstract = {To represent the local orientation and energy of a 1-D image signal, many models of early visual processing employ bandpass quadrature filters, formed by combining the original signal with its Hilbert transform. However, representations capable of estimating an image signal's 2-D phase have been largely ignored. Here, we consider 2-D phase representations using a method based upon the Riesz transform. For spatial images there exist two Riesz transformed signals and one original signal from which orientation, phase and energy may be represented as a vector in 3-D signal space. We show that these image properties may be represented by a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the higher-order derivatives of the original and the Riesz transformed signals. We further show that the expected responses of even and odd symmetric filters from the Riesz transform may be represented by a single signal autocorrelation function, which is beneficial in simplifying Bayesian computations for spatial orientation. Importantly, the Riesz transform allows one to weight linearly across orientation using both symmetric and asymmetric filters to account for some perceptual phase distortions observed in image signals - notably one's perception of edge structure within plaid patterns whose component gratings are either equal or unequal in contrast. Finally, exploiting the benefits that arise from the Riesz definition of local energy as a scalar quantity, we demonstrate the utility of Riesz signal representations in estimating the spatial orientation of second-order image signals. We conclude that the Riesz transform may be employed as a general tool for 2-D visual pattern recognition by its virtue of representing phase, orientation and energy as orthogonal signal quantities.},

@article{Morris:2010ys,
	Abstract = {Human vision remains perceptually stable even though retinal inputs change rapidly with each eye movement. Although the neural basis of visual stability remains unknown, a recent psychophysical study pointed to the existence of visual feature-representations anchored in environmental rather than retinal coordinates (e.g., "spatiotopic" receptive fields; Melcher and Morrone, 2003). In that study, sensitivity to a moving stimulus presented after a saccadic eye movement was enhanced when preceded by another moving stimulus at the same spatial location before the saccade. The finding is consistent with spatiotopic sensory integration, but it could also have arisen from a probabilistic improvement in performance due to the presence of more than one motion signal for the perceptual decision. Here we show that this statistical advantage accounts completely for summation effects in this task. We first demonstrate that measurements of summation are confounded by noise related to an observer's uncertainty about motion onset times. When this uncertainty is minimized, comparable summation is observed regardless of whether two motion signals occupy the same or different locations in space, and whether they contain the same or opposite directions of motion. These results are incompatible with the tuning properties of motion-sensitive sensory neurons and provide no evidence for a spatiotopic representation of visual motion. Instead, summation in this context reflects a decision mechanism that uses abstract representations of sensory events to optimize choice behavior.},

	Abstract = {Although there is general agreement that the human middle temporal (MT)/V5+ complex corresponds to monkey area MT/V5 proper plus a number of neighboring motion-sensitive areas, the identification of human MT/V5 within the complex has proven difficult. Here, we have used functional magnetic resonance imaging and the retinotopic mapping technique, which has very recently disclosed the organization of the visual field maps within the monkey MT/V5 cluster. We observed a retinotopic organization in humans very similar to that documented in monkeys: an MT/V5 cluster that includes areas MT/V5, pMSTv (putative ventral part of the medial superior temporal area), pFST (putative fundus of the superior temporal area), and pV4t (putative V4 transitional zone), and neighbors a more ventral putative human posterior inferior temporal area (phPIT) cluster. The four areas in the MT/V5 cluster and the two areas in the phPIT cluster each represent the complete contralateral hemifield. The complete MT/V5 cluster comprises 70\% of the motion localizer activation. Human MT/V5 is located in the region bound by lateral, anterior, and inferior occipital sulci and occupies only one-fifth of the motion complex. It shares the basic functional properties of its monkey homolog: receptive field size relative to other areas, response to moving and static stimuli, as well as sensitivity to three-dimensional structure from motion. Functional properties sharply distinguish the MT/V5 cluster from its immediate neighbors in the phPIT cluster and the LO (lateral occipital) regions. Together with similarities in retinotopic organization and topological neighborhood, the functional properties suggest that MT/V5 in human and macaque cortex are homologous.},

	Abstract = {Low-contrast visual contour fragments are easier to detect when presented in the context of nearby collinear contour elements (U. Polat \& D. Sagi, 1993). The spatial and temporal determinants of this collinear facilitation have been studied extensively (J. R. Cass \& B. Spehar, 2005; Y. Tanaka \& D. Sagi, 1998; C. B. Williams \& R. F. Hess, 1998), although considerable debate surrounds the neural mechanisms underlying it. Our study examines this question using a novel stimulus, whereby the flanking "contour" elements are rotated around their own axis. By measuring contrast detection thresholds to a brief foveal target presented at various phases of flanker rotation, we find peak facilitation after flankers have rotated beyond their collinear phase. This optimal facilitative delay increases monotonically as a function of target-flanker separation, yielding estimates of cortical propagation of 0.1 m/s, a value highly consistent with the dynamics of long-range horizontal interactions observed within primary visual cortex (V1). A curious new finding is also observed: Facilitative peaks also occur when the target flash precedes flanker collinearity by 20-80 ms, a range consistent with contrast-dependent cortical onset latencies. Together, these data suggest that collinear facilitation involves two separate mechanisms, each possessing distinct dynamics: (i) slowly propagating horizontal interactions within V1 and (ii) a faster integrative mechanism, possibly driven by synchronous collinear cortical onset.},

	Abstract = {Integration of inputs by cortical neurons provides the basis for the complex information processing performed in the cerebral cortex. Here, we have examined how primary visual cortical neurons integrate classical and nonclassical receptive field inputs. The effect of nonclassical receptive field stimuli and, correspondingly, of long-range intracortical inputs is known to be context-dependent: the same long-range stimulus can either facilitate or suppress responses, depending on the level of local activation. By constructing a large-scale model of primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that this effect can be understood in terms of the local cortical circuitry. Each receptive field position contributes both excitatory and inhibitory inputs; however, the inhibitory inputs have greater influence when overall receptive field drive is greater. This mechanism also explains contrast-dependent modulations within the classical receptive field, which similarly switch between excitatory and inhibitory. In order to simplify analysis and to explain the fundamental mechanisms of the model, self-contained modules that capture nonlinear local circuit interactions are constructed. This work supports the notion that receptive field integration is the result of local processing within small groups of neurons rather than in single neurons.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic random-dot stimuli have been widely used to explore central mechanisms of motion processing. We have measured the responses of neurons in area MT of the alert monkey while we varied the strength and direction of the motion signal in such displays. The strength of motion is controlled by the proportion of spatiotemporally correlated dots, which we term the correlation of the stimulus. For many MT cells, responses varied approximately linearly with stimulus correlation. When they occurred, nonlinearities were equally likely to be either positively or negatively accelerated. We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells' discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low-level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning.},

@article{Britten:1992ly,
	Abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},

@article{Tsui:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the primate extrastriate cortex are highly selective for complex stimulus features such as faces, objects, and motion patterns. One explanation for this selectivity is that neurons in these areas carry out sophisticated computations on the outputs of lower-level areas such as V1, where neuronal selectivity is often modeled in terms of linear spatiotemporal filters. However, such simple V1 models are incomplete, as they fail to capture important nonlinearities that can substantially alter neuronal selectivity for specific stimulus features. Thus a key step in understanding the function of higher cortical areas is the development of realistic models of their V1 inputs. We have addressed this issue by constructing a computational model of the V1 neurons that provide the strongest input to extrastriate cortical area MT. We find that a modest elaboration to the standard model of V1 direction selectivity generates model neurons with strong end-stopping, a property found in the V1 layers that provide input to MT. The seemingly complex properties of MT neurons can then be simulated by assuming that they perform a simple nonlinear summation of their inputs. The resulting model, which has a very small number of free parameters, can simulate many of the diverse properties of MT neurons. In particular, we simulate the invariance of MT tuning curves to the orientation and length of tilted bar stimuli, as well as the accompanying temporal dynamics. We also show how this property relates to the continuum from component to pattern selectivity observed when MT neurons are tested with plaids. Finally, we confirm several key predictions of the model by recording from MT neurons in the alert macaque monkey. Overall our results demonstrate that many of the seemingly complex computations carried out by high-level cortical neurons can in principle be understood by examining the properties of their inputs.},

@article{Wichmann:2001kx,
	Abstract = {The psychometric function relates an observer's performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task. This paper, together with its companion paper (Wichmann \& Hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function's parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. The present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. First, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (or lapses). We show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function's parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. Second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. We demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditional chi2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of Monte Carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. We have made available the software to implement our methods.},

@article{Wichmann:2001uq,
	Abstract = {The psychometric function relates an observer's performance to an independent variable, usually a physical quantity of an experimental stimulus. Even if a model is successfully fit to the data and its goodness of fit is acceptable, experimenters require an estimate of the variability of the parameters to assess whether differences across conditions are significant. Accurate estimates of variability are difficult to obtain, however, given the typically small size of psychophysical data sets: Traditional statistical techniques are only asymptotically correct and can be shown to be unreliable in some common situations. Here and in our companion paper (Wichmann \& Hill, 2001), we suggest alternative statistical techniques based on Monte Carlo resampling methods. The present paper's principal topic is the estimation of the variability of fitted parameters and derived quantities, such as thresholds and slopes. First, we outline the basic bootstrap procedure and argue in favor of the parametric, as opposed to the nonparametric, bootstrap. Second, we describe how the bootstrap bridging assumption, on which the validity of the procedure depends, can be tested. Third, we show how one's choice of sampling scheme (the placement of sample points on the stimulus axis) strongly affects the reliability of bootstrap confidence intervals, and we make recommendations on how to sample the psychometric function efficiently. Fourth, we show that, under certain circumstances, the (arbitrary) choice of the distribution function can exert an unwanted influence on the size of the bootstrap confidence intervals obtained, and we make recommendations on how to avoid this influence. Finally, we introduce improved confidence intervals (bias corrected and accelerated) that improve on the parametric and percentile-based bootstrap confidence intervals previously used. Software implementing our methods is available.},

	Abstract = {During normal viewing, the eyes move from one location to another in order to sample the visual environment. Information acquired before the eye movement facilitates post-saccadic processing. This "preview effect" indicates that some information is maintained in transsaccadic memory and combined with information acquired at the next fixation. However, the nature of transsaccadic memory remains a subject of debate. Here, we investigate preview effects in monkeys that carry out a contour-grouping (curve-tracing) task, by manipulating the consistency between pre- and post-saccadic information. The results show that consistent information causes a preview benefit, whereas inconsistent information causes a preview cost. These preview effects are relatively independent of the pre-saccadic viewing duration, and they occur even when the stimulus is exposed for only approximately 10 ms. The results further demonstrate that an entire relevant curve is stored in transsaccadic memory, instead of just the items at the saccade goal. They suggest that preview effects are caused by a mechanism that stores attended sensory information to make it available at the next fixation. The results are discussed within a theoretical framework that establishes an intimate relationship between attention, short-term memory and transsaccadic memory.},

@article{Roelfsema:2004kx,
	Abstract = {The visual system imposes structure onto incoming information, by grouping image elements of a single object together, and by segregating them from elements that belong to other objects and the background. One influential theory holds that the code for grouping and segmentation is carried by the synchrony of neuronal discharges on a millisecond time scale. We tested this theory by recording neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys engaged in a contour-grouping task. We found that synchrony was unrelated to contour grouping. The firing rates of V1 neurons are also correlated across trials. We demonstrate that this rate covariation is mainly determined by fluctuations in visual attention. Moreover, we show that rate covariation depends on perceptual grouping, as it is strongest between neurons that respond to features of the same object.},

@article{Pesaran:2008uq,
	Abstract = {We often face alternatives that we are free to choose between. Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals.},

@article{Roelfsema:1999fk,
	Abstract = {The speed of contour integration was investigated in a task that can be solved by grouping contour segments into elongated curves. Subjects had to detect a continuous curve, which could be intersected by one or two other curves. At locations where these curves came in close proximity, the assignment of contour segments to the different curves could be based on collinearity. Reaction times exhibited a strong dependence on (1) the presence of intersections among curves; and (2) the context provided by the stimulus set from which individual stimuli were selected. Reaction times were shortest when grouping of contour segments depended on information at a single location in the visual field. In this condition, responses to stimuli containing an intersection were faster than responses to stimuli that did not. When responses were determined by information at spatially separate locations, responses were delayed, and every intersection increased the reaction time considerably. This result contrasts with earlier investigations which have suggested that contour integration on the basis of collinearity is performed pre-attentively but is in accordance with studies on curve tracing. We propose that the assignment of contour segments to equally coherent curves, a process which may be called figure-figure segregation, is a function of object-based attention. Moreover, the protracted reaction times for some of the stimuli indicate that spread of attention within an object costs time. This implies that object recognition is not always as fast as is sometimes assumed.},

	Abstract = {We quantified and compared the effect of element spacing on contour integration between the achromatic (Ach), red-green (RG), and blue-yellow (BY) mechanisms. The task requires the linking of orientation across space to detect a contour in a stimulus composed of randomly oriented Gabor elements (1.5 cpd, sigma = 0.17 deg), measured using a temporal 2AFC method. A contour of ten elements was pasted into a 10 x 10 cells array, a ndbackground elements were randomly positioned within the available cells. The effect of element spacing was investigated by varying the mean interelement distance between two and six times the period of the Gabor elements (lambda = 0.66 deg) while the total number of elements was fixed. Contour detection was measured as a function of its curvature for jagged contours and for closed contours. At all curvatures, we found that performance for chromatic mechanisms declines more steeply with the increase in element separation than does performance for the achromatic mechanism. Averaged critical element separations were 4.6 +/- 0.7, 3.6 +/- 0.4, and 2.9 +/- 0.2 deg for Ach, BY, and RG mechanisms, respectively. These results suggest that contour integration by the chromatic mechanisms relies more on short-range interactions in comparison to the achromatic mechanism. In a further experiment, we looked at the combined effect of element size and element separation in contour integration for the Ach mechanism. We found that the critical separation decreases linearly with the spatial frequency, from about 5 deg at low spatial frequency (larger elements) to about 1 deg at high spatial frequency (smaller elements) suggesting a scale invariance in contour integration. In both experiments we also found no differences between closed and open jagged contours detection in terms of element separation. The neuroanatomical implications of these findings relatively to area V1 are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We examined a variant of the anomalous motion illusion. In a series of experiments, we ascertained luminance contrast to be the critical factor. Low-contrast random dots showed longer latency than high-contrast ones, irrespective of whether they were dark or light (experiments 1 -3). We conjecture that this illusion may share the same mechanism with the Hess effect, which is characterised by visual delay of a low-contrast, dark stimulus in a moving situation. Since the Hess effect is known as the monocular version of the Pulfrich effect, we examined whether illusory motion in depth could be observed if a high-contrast pattern was projected to one eye and the same pattern of low-contrast was presented to the other eye, and they were binocularly fused and swayed horizontally. Observers then reported illusory motion in depth when the low-contrast pattern was dark, but they did not when it was bright (experiment 4). Possible explanations of this inconsistency are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The neural basis of illusory motion perception evoked from static images has not been established well. We examined changes in neural activity in motion sensitive areas of the human visual cortex by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique when a static illusory-motion image ('Rotating Snakes') was presented to participants. The blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were compared between the test stimulus that induced illusory motion perception and the control stimulus that did not. Comparison was also made between those stimuli with and without eye movements. Signal changes for the test stimulus were significantly larger than those for the control stimulus, if accompanied by eye movements. On the other hand, the difference in signal changes between test and control stimuli was smaller, if steady fixation was required. These results support the empirical finding that this illusion is related to some component of eye movements.},

	Abstract = {A new class of patterns, composed of repeating patches of asymmetric intensity profile, elicit strong perception of illusory motion. We propose that the main cause of this illusion is erroneous estimation of image motion induced by fixational eye movements. Image motion is estimated with spatial and temporal energy filters, which are symmetric in space, but asymmetric (causal) in time. That is, only the past, but not the future, is used to estimate the temporal energy. It is shown that such filters mis-estimate the motion of locally asymmetric intensity signals at certain spatial frequencies. In an experiment the perception of the different illusory signals was quantitatively compared by nulling the illusory motion with opposing real motion, and was found to be predicted well by the model.},

	Abstract = {We evaluated spatial displacement and temporal duration thresholds for discriminating the motion direction of gratings for a broad range of speeds (0.06 degrees/s to 30 degrees/s) in fovea and at +/-30 degrees eccentricity. In general, increased speed yielded lower duration thresholds but higher displacement thresholds. In most conditions, these effects of speed were comparable in fovea and periphery, yielding relatively similar thresholds not correlated with decreased peripheral acuity. The noteworthy exceptions were interactive effects at slow speeds: (1) Displacement thresholds for peripheral motion were affected by acuity limits for speeds below 0.5 degrees/s. (2) Low-vision observers with congenital nystagmus had elevated thresholds for peripheral motion and slow foveal motion but resembled typically sighted observers for foveal motions at speeds above 1 degree/s. (3) Suppressive center-surround interactions were absent below 0.5 degrees/s and their strength increased with speed. Overall, these results indicate qualitatively different sensitivities to slow and fast motions. Thresholds for very slow motion are limited by spatial resolution, while thresholds for fast motion are probably limited by temporal resolution.},

@article{Scalf:2010kl,
	Abstract = {Traditional explanations of our limited attentional capacity focus on our ability to direct attention to multiple items. We ask whether this difficulty in simultaneously attending to multiple items stems from an inability to effectively represent multiple attended items. Although attending to one of a set of neighboring stimuli can isolate it from competitive interactions in visual cortex, no such isolation should occur if multiple competing items are attended. Indeed, we find that attention is ineffective at enhancing blood oxygen level-dependent signal in visual cortical area V4 when it is directed to three stimuli simultaneously, but only when those three stimuli compete in visual cortex. This suggests that competition may prevent attention from acting as effectively on representations of multiple items as it does on representations of a single item. In contrast to traditional explanations that posit limits in the sources of attentional control, we show that mechanisms at the sites of stimulus representation may also impose limits on our ability to attend to multiple items simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {We present a model of human preattentive texture perception. This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers.},

	Abstract = {The human brain manages to correctly interpret almost every visual image it receives from the environment. Underlying this ability are contour grouping mechanisms that appropriately link local edge elements into global contours. Although a general view of how the brain achieves effective contour grouping has emerged, there have been a number of different specific proposals and few successes at quantitatively predicting performance. These previous proposals have been developed largely by intuition and computational trial and error. A more principled approach is to begin with an examination of the statistical properties of contours that exist in natural images, because it is these statistics that drove the evolution of the grouping mechanisms. Here we report measurements of both absolute and Bayesian edge co-occurrence statistics in natural images, as well as human performance for detecting natural-shaped contours in complex backgrounds. We find that contour detection performance is quantitatively predicted by a local grouping rule derived directly from the co-occurrence statistics, in combination with a very simple integration rule (a transitivity rule) that links the locally grouped contour elements into longer contours.},

	Abstract = {How do we decide where to look next? During natural, active vision, we move our eyes to gather task-relevant information from the visual scene. Information theory provides an elegant framework for investigating how visual stimulus information combines with prior knowledge and task goals to plan an eye movement. We measured eye movements as observers performed a shape-learning and -matching task, for which the task-relevant information was tightly controlled. Using computational models, we probe the underlying strategies used by observers when planning their next eye movement. One strategy is to move the eyes to locations that maximize the total information gained about the shape, which is equivalent to reducing global uncertainty. Observers' behavior may appear highly similar to this strategy, but a rigorous analysis of sequential fixation placement reveals that observers may instead be using a local rule: fixate only the most informative locations, that is, reduce local uncertainty.},

@article{Ledgeway:2005vn,
	Abstract = {Over the last decade or so a great deal of psychophysical research has attempted to delineate the principles by which local orientations and motions are combined across space to facilitate the detection of simple spatial contours. This has led to the development of "association field" models of contour detection which suggest that the strength of linking between neighbouring elements in an image, is determined by the degree to which they aligned along smooth (first-order) curves. To test this assumption we used a path detection paradigm to compare the ability of observers to identify the presence of contours defined by either spatial orientation, motion direction or by specific combinations of both types of visual attribute. The relative alignment of the local orientations and/or directions with respect to the axis of the depicted contour was systematically varied. For orientation-defined contours detection was best when the elements were aligned along (parallel with) the contour axis, approached chance levels for obliquely oriented elements and then improved for elements that were orthogonal to the contour axis (i.e., performance was a U-shaped function of degree of orientation misalignment). This pattern of results was found for both straight and curved contours and is not readily explicable in terms of current association field theories. For motion-defined contours, however, performance simply deteriorated as the relative directions of the constituent path elements were progressively misaligned with respect to the contour. Thus the rules by which local orientations are linked to define spatial contours are qualitatively different from those used for linking local directions and each may be mediated by distinct visual mechanisms. When both orientation and motion cues were simultaneously available, contour detection performance was generally enhanced, in a manner that is consistent with probability summation. We suggest that association field models of orientation linking may need to be extended in light of the present findings.},

@article{Field:1993kx,
	Annote = { The Gestalt law of "good continuation" has been used to describe a variety of phenomena demonstrating the importance of continuity in human perception. In this study, we consider how continuity may be represented by a visual system that filters spatial data using arrays of cells selective for orientation and spatial frequency. Many structures (e.g. fractal contours) show a form of redundancy which is well represented by the continuity of features as they vary across space and frequency. We suggest that it is possible to take advantage of the redundancy in continuous, but non-aligned features by associating the outputs of filters with similar tuning. Five experiments were performed, to determine the rules that govern the perception of continuity. Observers were presented with arrays of oriented, band-pass elements (Gabor patches) in which a subset of the elements was aligned along a "jagged" path. Using a forced-choice procedure, observers were found to be capable of identifying the path within a field of randomly-oriented elements even when the spacing between the elements was considerably larger than the size of any of the individual elements. Furthermore, when the elements were oriented at angles up to $\pm$ 60 deg relative to one another, the path was reliably identified. Alignment of the elements along the path was found to play a large role in the ability to detect the path. Small variations in the alignment or aligning the elements orthogonally (i.e. "side-to-side" as opposed to "end-to-end") significantly reduced the observer's ability to detect the presence of a path. The results are discussed in terms of an "association field" which integrates information across neighboring filters tuned to similar orientations. We suggest that some of the processes involved in texture segregation may have a similar explanation.},

	Abstract = {A contour formed of aligned Gabor patches is easily detected amidst a dense background of randomly oriented patches; the longer the string of aligned patches, the more easily the contour is detected (D. J. Field, A. Hayes, & R. F. Hess, 1993). Here we show that a short string of collinear elements acts as a cue pointing to other patches of similar orientation that lie along the path defined by the string. Cueing might increase the gain of similarly oriented elements in the vicinity and/or reduce the number of potential locations (uncertainty) that the observer monitors. To assess the strength of the contour cue, I measured sensitivity to contrast increments on a test patch placed at various offsets relative to the cueing contour. Noise density and the length of cueing contour were also manipulated. Signal detection theory analysis of the psychometric function provided estimates of the gain and uncertainty parameters associated with each condition. In the presence of noise, observers were best at detecting a contrast increment on a patch that was aligned with the cueing string. Gain estimates were high for the aligned condition but decreased with increasing offset from this position. Uncertainty estimates were invariant with offset at a given noise level but increased with increasing noise. Uncertainty also decreased significantly when the length of the cueing string was increased. The high gain for collinear test patches and the ability of the contour to reduce uncertainty at high noise densities is indeed similar to the effect of an explicit cue (e.g., Z.-L. Lu & B. A. Dosher, 1998), suggesting that one part of the contour cues other parts and contributes to the detectability of contours in noise.},

	Abstract = {The second visual cortical area (V2) of the primate is composed of repeating thin, pale, and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes containing primarily color-selective, broad-band oriented, and disparity-selective cells, respectively. We have now examined topography in V2 with respect to these functional subdivisions. Our data suggest that there are multiple, interleaved visual maps in V2, one for each of the color, orientation, and disparity domains. The same region of visual space is re-represented by each stripe within a stripe cycle, resulting in discontinuities or "jumps back" in representation at stripe borders. Adjacent stripe cycles represent adjacent regions of space such that the visual map is continuous from one stripe to the next like stripe. Receptive field size and scatter are significantly larger for thin stripes than for thick stripes. Unexpectedly, our data suggest two types of pale stripes within each stripe cycle, one with scatter similar to thin stripes and another to thick stripes. Some evidence also suggests the presence of multiple maps within individual stripes in V2. Consistent with functional clustering within single stripes (Ts'o et al., 1990b), we have recorded re-representations and topographic discontinuities coincident with functional borders within single stripes. These results suggest that multiple and interleaved mapping may be a common organizational strategy for representing multiple functional domains within a single cortical area.},

	Abstract = {The size of the functional visual field (FVF) is dynamic, changing with the context and attentive demand that each fixation brings as we move our eyes and head to explore the visual scene. Using performance measures of the FVF we show that during search conditions with eye movements, the FVF is small compared to the size of the FVF measured during search without eye movements. In all cases the size of the FVF is constrained by the density of distracting items. During search without eye movements the FVF expands with time; subjects have idiosyncratic spatial biases suggesting covert shifts of attention. For search within the constraints imposed by item density, the rate of item inspection is the same across all search conditions. Array set size effects are not apparent once stimulus density is taken into account, a result that is consistent with a spatial constraint for the FVF based on the cortical separation hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Our previous research examined the effects of target eccentricity and global stimulus density on target detection during active visual search in monkey. Here, eye movement data collected from three human subjects on a standard single-color Ts and Ls task with varying set sizes were used to analyze the probability of target detection as a function of local stimulus density. Search performance was found to exhibit a systematic dependence on local stimulus density around the target and as a function of target eccentricity when density is calculated with respect to cortical space, in accordance with a model of the retinocortical geometrical transformation of image data onto the surface of V1. Density as measured by nearest neighbor separation and target image size as calculated from target eccentricity were found to contribute independently to search performance when measured with respect to cortical space but not with standard visual space. Density relationships to performance did not differ when target and nearest neighbor were on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, underscoring the hypothesis that such interactions were occurring within higher visual areas. The cortical separation of items appears to be the major determinant of array set size effects in active visual search.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of target detection as a function of target eccentricity was made on eye movement data collected from three monkey subjects during active visual search. Target detection probability was invariant across array set size and eccentricity conditions when the cortical density of relevant stimuli surrounding the target was held constant. When target color was used to guide search, the effective cortical density was the density of stimuli that shared the target's color. Thus the passive constraint of cortical magnification in combination with an active selection for a stimulus attribute, in this case color, sets the spatial framework for detection of the target.},

	Abstract = {The mapping of the topographic representation of the visual field onto cortical areas changes throughout the hierarchy of cortical visual areas. The changes are believed to reflect the establishment of modules with different spatial processing emphasis. The receptive fields (RFs) of neurons within these modules, however, may not be governed by the same spatial topographic map parameters. Here it is shown that the RFs of area V4 neurons (centered 1-12 degrees in eccentricity) are based on a circularly symmetric sampling of the primary visual cortical retinotopic map. No eccentricity dependent magnification beyond that observed in V1 is apparent in the V4 neurons. The size and shape of V4 RFs can be explained by a simple, constant sized, two-dimensional Gaussian sample of visual input from the retinotopic map laid out across the surface of V1.

	Abstract = {In human vision, the optics of the eye map neighboring points of the environment onto neighboring photoreceptors in the retina. This retinotopic encoding principle is preserved in the early visual areas. Under normal viewing conditions, due to the motion of objects and to eye movements, the retinotopic representation of the environment undergoes fast and drastic shifts. Yet, perceptually our environment appears stable suggesting the existence of non-retinotopic representations in addition to the well-known retinotopic ones. Here, we present a simple psychophysical test to determine whether a given visual process is accomplished in retino- or non-retinotopic coordinates. As examples, we show that visual search and motion perception can occur within a non-retinotopic frame of reference. These findings suggest that more mechanisms than previously thought operate non-retinotopically. Whether this is true for a given visual process can easily be found out with our ``litmus test.''},

	Abstract = {The organization of projections from V1 to areas V2 and V3 in the macaque monkey was studied with a combination of anatomical techniques, including lesions and tracer injections made in different portions of V1 and V2 in 20 experimental hemispheres. Our results indicate that dorsal V1 (representing the inferior contralateral visual quadrant) consistently projects in topographically organized fashion to V3 in the lunate and parietooccipital sulci as well as to the middle temporal area (MT) and dorsal V2. In contrast, ventral V1 (representing the superior contralateral quadrant) projects only to MT and ventral V2. A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field. The average surface area of myeloarchitectonically identified V3 was 89 mm2. Additional information was obtained concerning the laminar distribution of connections from V1 to V2 and V3, the patchiness of these projections, and the consistency of projections to other extrastriate areas, including V4 and V3A.},

	Abstract = {The location, topographic organization, and function of the middle temporal visual area (MT) in the macaque monkey was studied using anatomical and physiological techniques. MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3\% of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex. Electrophysiological recordings have confirmed previous reports of a high incidence of direction selective cells in MT. The transition in functional properties, from cells lacking direction selectivity outside MT to direction selective cells within, occurs over a distance of 0.1-0.2 mm or less along the lateral border of MT. Such a transition does not occur along the medial border, however, as the cortex medial to MT contains many cells with strong direction selectivity. Nevertheless, this region differs from MT in its myeloarchitecture, its lack of inputs from striate cortex, and the large size of its receptive fields. These results demonstrate the existence of three distinct visual areas on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be distinguished on the basis of both physiological and anatomical criteria.},

	Abstract = {The topographic organization of striate cortex in the macaque was studied using physiological recording techniques. Results were displayed on two-dimensional maps of the cortex, which facilitated the quantitative analysis of various features of the visual representation. The representation was found to be asymmetric with more cortex devoted to lower than to upper fields. Over much of striate cortex the representation is anisotropic, in that the magnification factor depends upon the direction along which it is measured. There is considerable individual variability in these features as well as in the overall size of striate cortex. Outside the fovea, the cortical representation shows only modest deviations from a logarithmic conformal mapping, in which the magnification factor is proportional to the inverse of eccentricity in the visual field. Comparison of receptive field size with cortical magnification was used to estimate the "point image size" in the cortex (i.e. the extent of cortex concerned with processing inputs from any given point in the visual field). Our evidence supports a previous report that point-image size varies significantly with eccentricity. This is of interest in relation to anatomical evidence that the dimensions of columnar systems in striate cortex are largely independent of eccentricity.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate some procedures in the statistical computing environment R for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a psychometric function by fitting a generalized nonlinear regression model to the data. A feature for fitting a linear model to the threshold (or other) parameters of several psychometric functions simultaneously provides a powerful tool for testing hypotheses about the data and, potentially, for reducing the number of parameters necessary to describe them. Finally, we illustrate procedures for treating one parameter as a random effect that would permit a simplified approach to modeling stimulus-independent variability due to factors such as lapses or interobserver differences. These tools will facilitate a more comprehensive and explicit approach to the modeling of psychometric data.},

	Abstract = {Simple perceptual decisions are ideally suited for studying the sensorimotor transformations underlying flexible behavior. During perceptual detection, a noisy sensory signal is converted into a behavioral report of the presence or absence of a perceptual experience. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to link the dynamics of neural population activity in human motor cortex to perceptual choices in a "yes/no" visual motion detection task. We found that (1) motor response-selective MEG activity in the "gamma" (64-100 Hz) and "beta" (12-36 Hz) frequency ranges predicted subjects' choices several seconds before their overt manual response; (2) this choice-predictive activity built up gradually during stimulus viewing toward both "yes" and "no" choices; and (3) the choice-predictive activity in motor cortex reflected the temporal integral of gamma-band activity in motion-sensitive area MT during stimulus viewing. Because gamma-band activity in MT reflects visual motion strength, these findings suggest that, during motion detection, motor plans for both "yes" and "no" choices result from continuously accumulating sensory evidence. We conclude that frequency-specific neural population activity at the cortical output stage of sensorimotor pathways provides a window into the mechanisms underlying perceptual decisions.},

	Abstract = {How does the brain make decisions? Speed and accuracy of perceptual decisions covary with certainty in the input, and correlate with the rate of evidence accumulation in parietal and frontal cortical "decision neurons". A biophysically realistic model of interactions within and between Retina/LGN and cortical areas V1, MT, MST, and LIP, gated by basal ganglia, simulates dynamic properties of decision-making in response to ambiguous visual motion stimuli used by Newsome, Shadlen, and colleagues in their neurophysiological experiments. The model clarifies how brain circuits that solve the aperture problem interact with a recurrent competitive network with self-normalizing choice properties to carry out probabilistic decisions in real time. Some scientists claim that perception and decision-making can be described using Bayesian inference or related general statistical ideas, that estimate the optimal interpretation of the stimulus given priors and likelihoods. However, such concepts do not propose the neocortical mechanisms that enable perception, and make decisions. The present model explains behavioral and neurophysiological decision-making data without an appeal to Bayesian concepts and, unlike other existing models of these data, generates perceptual representations and choice dynamics in response to the experimental visual stimuli. Quantitative model simulations include the time course of LIP neuronal dynamics, as well as behavioral accuracy and reaction time properties, during both correct and error trials at different levels of input ambiguity in both fixed duration and reaction time tasks. Model MT/MST interactions compute the global direction of random dot motion stimuli, while model LIP computes the stochastic perceptual decision that leads to a saccadic eye movement.},

	Abstract = {There are many instances in which human subjects perceive a component which is not physically present in a visual stimulus. To study the cerebral activity which correlates with the perception of such an illusory component, we chose Enigma, a static figure in which many subjects perceive illusory motion. By using the technique of positron emission tomography (PET) we recorded the relative regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the brain of 13 subjects while they viewed it and reported seeing the illusory motion. We found that, when subjects perceived illusory motion, the increases in rCBF took place in regions of the brain closely related to, and perhaps identical with, area V5, as defined by the site of rCBF change that took place when the same subjects viewed a physically moving stimulus. In addition, there was activity in other cortical areas outside the visual cortex, not present when the subjects had been viewing objective motion. This suggests that the generation of illusory motion depends not only on a highly specific visual area but also on relative contributions from other parts of the brain that are not activated to the same extent when humans perceive objective motion.},

	Abstract = {'To determine orientation we occasionally used a PDP-12 computer to produce a graph of average response vs orientation, generating the slit electronically on a television screen. This method took much longer, and the usual minute-to-minute variations in responsiveness of the cell tended to make the curves broader and noisier. We concluded that for both speed and for precision it is hard to beat judgments based on the human ear. Certainly [our curves] could not have been obtained with computer averaging methods before the authors reached the age of mandatory retirement.' (Hubel \& Wiesel, 1974).},

	Abstract = {1. Anatomical studies have shown the cortex of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus to receive a projection from visual cortical areas, including areas 17, 18 and 19. In this paper the response of single neurones in this area to simple visual stimulation is reported. Ten monkeys were studied.2. A clear but relatively crude topographic representation of the visual field was found. There was a large variation in the size of the receptive fields of individual cells, even in a single penetration. Some cells, with the central parts of their receptive fields located from between 1 and 5 degrees from the centre of gaze had receptive fields averaging about 10 degrees x 10 degrees or even larger. Other cells with central receptive fields had much smaller field sizes.3. Two main types of neurones were encountered, with subdivisions within each type. The first type responded to movement irrespective of form. These could be subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded to movement in one direction only (directionally selective neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.4. In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar organization for movement.5. Combined anatomical (degeneration) and electrophysiological experiments showed that these types of neurones are found in those regions of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus receiving a direct projection from area 17.},

@article{Pelli:2004km,
	Abstract = {A letter in the peripheral visual field is much harder to identify in the presence of nearby letters. This is "crowding." Both crowding and ordinary masking are special cases of "masking," which, in general, refers to any effect of a "mask" pattern on the discriminability of a signal. Here we characterize crowding, and propose a diagnostic test to distinguish it from ordinary masking. In ordinary masking, the signal disappears. In crowding, it remains visible, but is ambiguous, jumbled with its neighbors. Masks are usually effective only if they overlap the signal, but the crowding effect extends over a large region. The width of that region is proportional to signal eccentricity from the fovea and independent of signal size, mask size, mask contrast, signal and mask font, and number of masks. At 4 deg eccentricity, the threshold contrast for identification of a 0.32 deg signal letter is elevated (up to six-fold) by mask letters anywhere in a 2.3 deg region, 7 times wider than the signal. In ordinary masking, threshold contrast rises as a power function of mask contrast, with a shallow log-log slope of 0.5 to 1, whereas, in crowding, threshold is a sigmoidal function of mask contrast, with a steep log-log slope of 2 at close spacing. Most remarkably, although the threshold elevation decreases exponentially with spacing, the threshold and saturation contrasts of crowding are independent of spacing. Finally, ordinary masking is similar for detection and identification, but crowding occurs only for identification, not detection. More precisely, crowding occurs only in tasks that cannot be done based on a single detection by coarsely coded feature detectors. These results (and observers' introspections) suggest that ordinary masking blocks feature detection, so the signal disappears, while crowding (like "illusory conjunction") is excessive feature integration - detected features are integrated over an inappropriately large area because there are no smaller integration fields - so the integrated signal is ambiguous, jumbled with the mask. In illusory conjunction, observers see an object that is not there made up of features that are. A survey of the illusory conjunction literature finds that most of the illusory conjunction results are consistent with the spatial crowding described here, which depends on spatial proximity, independent of time pressure. The rest seem to arise through a distinct phenomenon that one might call "temporal crowding," which depends on time pressure ("overloading attention"), independent of spatial proximity.},

	Abstract = {Neurons at progressively higher levels of the visual system have progressively larger, more complicated receptive fields, presumably constructed from simpler antecedent receptive fields. To study this hierarchical organization, we used sparse white noise to map receptive-field substructure (second order Wiener-like kernels) in an extrastriate motion processing area (MT) of alert monkeys. The maps revealed a clear substructure, on a spatial scale comparable to the receptive fields of the V1 inputs. There were both facilitatory and suppressive interactions that differed in spatial organization and time course. Directional interactions were remarkably precise over a very small spatial range, and reversed when successive stimuli reversed contrast--a neural correlate of "reverse phi" motion perception. The maps of some cells had an unexpected, curved shape, which challenges existing models for direction selectivity.},

We found that layer 6 neurons of V2 are crucial for the processing of object-recognition memory (ORM). Using the protein regulator of G protein signaling-14 (RGS-14) as a tool, we found that the expression of this protein into layer 6 neurons of rat-brain area V2 promoted the conversion of a normal short-term ORM that normally lasts for 45 minutes into long-term memory detectable even after many months. Furthermore, elimination of the same-layer neurons by means of injection of a selective cytotoxin resulted in the complete loss of normal as well as protein-mediated enhanced ORM.},

	Abstract = {Our ability to identify alphanumeric characters can be impaired by the presence of nearby features, especially when the target is presented in the peripheral visual field, a phenomenon is known as crowding. We measured the effects of motion on acuity and on the spatial extent of crowding. In line with many previous studies, acuity decreased and crowding increased with eccentricity. Acuity also decreased for moving targets, but the absolute size of crowding zones remained relatively invariant of speed at each eccentricity. The two-dimensional shape of crowding zones was measured with a single flanking element on each side of the target. Crowding zones were elongated radially about central vision, relative to tangential zones, and were also asymmetrical: a more peripheral flanking element crowded more effectively than a more foveal one; and a flanking element that moved ahead of the target crowded more effectively than one that trailed behind it. These results reveal asymmetrical space-time dependent regions of visual integration that are radially organised about central vision.},

	Abstract = {Peripheral vision for static form is limited both by reduced spatial acuity and by interference among adjacent features ('crowding'). However, the visibility of acuity-corrected image motion is relatively constant across the visual field. We measured whether spatial interference among nearby moving elements is similarly invariant of retinal eccentricity and assessed if motion integration could account for any observed sensitivity loss. We report that sensitivity to the direction of motion of a central target-highly visible in isolation-was strongly impaired by four drifting flanking elements. The extent of spatial interference increased with eccentricity. Random-direction flanks and flanks whose directions formed global patterns of rotation or expansion were more disruptive than flanks forming global patterns of translation, regardless of the relative direction of the target element. Spatial interference was low-pass tuned for spatial frequency and broadly tuned for temporal frequency. We show that these results challenge the generality of models of spatial interference that are based on retinal image quality, masking, confusions between target and flanks, attentional resolution limits or (simple) "averaging" of element parameters. Instead, the results suggest that spatial interference is a consequence of the integration of meaningful image structure within large receptive fields. The underlying connectivity of this integration favours low spatial frequency structure but is broadly tuned for speed.},

	Abstract = {It is now emerging that vision is usually limited by object spacing rather than size. The visual system recognizes an object by detecting and then combining its features. 'Crowding' occurs when objects are too close together and features from several objects are combined into a jumbled percept. Here, we review the explosion of studies on crowding-in grating discrimination, letter and face recognition, visual search, selective attention, and reading-and find a universal principle, the Bouma law. The critical spacing required to prevent crowding is equal for all objects, although the effect is weaker between dissimilar objects. Furthermore, critical spacing at the cortex is independent of object position, and critical spacing at the visual field is proportional to object distance from fixation. The region where object spacing exceeds critical spacing is the 'uncrowded window'. Observers cannot recognize objects outside of this window and its size limits the speed of reading and search.},

@article{Levi:2008la,
	Abstract = {Crowding, generally defined as the deleterious influence of nearby contours on visual discrimination, is ubiquitous in spatial vision. Crowding impairs the ability to recognize objects in clutter. It has been extensively studied over the last 80 years or so, and much of the renewed interest is the hope that studying crowding may lead to a better understanding of the processes involved in object recognition. Crowding also has important clinical implications for patients with macular degeneration, amblyopia and dyslexia. There is no shortage of theories for crowding-from low-level receptive field models to high-level attention. The current picture is that crowding represents an essential bottleneck for object perception, impairing object perception in peripheral, amblyopic and possibly developing vision. Crowding is neither masking nor surround suppression. We can localize crowding to the cortex, perhaps as early as V1; however, there is a growing consensus for a two-stage model of crowding in which the first stage involves the detection of simple features (perhaps in V1), and a second stage is required for the integration or interpretation of the features as an object beyond V1. There is evidence for top-down effects in crowding, but the role of attention in this process remains unclear. The strong effect of learning in shrinking the spatial extent of crowding places strong constraints on possible models for crowding and for object recognition. The goal of this review is to try to provide a broad, balanced and succinct review that organizes and summarizes the diverse and scattered studies of crowding, and also helps to explain it to the non-specialist. A full understanding of crowding may allow us to understand this bottleneck to object recognition and the rules that govern the integration of features into objects.},

	Abstract = {When one element in an apparent motion sequence differs in color from the others, it is perceived as shifted along the motion trajectory. We examined whether V4 neurons encode the physical or perceived location of this "flashed" element by recording neuronal responses while monkeys viewed these stimuli. The retinotopic locus of V4 activity evoked by the flashed element shifted along the motion trajectory. The magnitude of the shift is consistent with the perceptual shift in humans viewing identical stimuli. This retinotopic distortion depended on the presence of a flashed element but was observed for both color-selective and non-color-selective neurons. The distortion was undiminished when the flashed element terminated the sequence, a condition that reduced the perceptual shift in humans. These findings are consistent with a Bayesian model of localization in which perceived location is derived from position signals optimally integrated across visual areas.},

	Abstract = {In a recent article, Pelli, Palomares, and Majaj (2004) suggested that feature binding is mediated by hard-wired integration fields instead of a spotlight of spatial attention (as assumed by Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Consequently, the correct conjoining of visual features can be guaranteed only when there are no other competing features within a circle with a radius of approximately 0.5E (E = eccentricity of the target object). This claim seems contradicted by an observation that we can easily see--for example, the orientation of a single blue bar within a dense array of randomly oriented red bars. In the present study, possible determinants of the extent of crowding (or feature integration) zones were analyzed with feature (color) singletons as targets. It was found that the number of distractors has a dramatic effect on crowding. With a few distractors, a normal crowding effect was observed. However, by increasing the number of distractors, the crowding effect was remarkably reduced. Similar results were observed when the target and distractors were of the same color and when only a differently colored circle indicated the target location. The results can be explained by bottom-up "attention" that facilitates the processing of information from salient locations in the visual field.},

	Abstract = {Visual crowding refers to the marked inability to identify an otherwise perfectly identifiable object when it is flanked by other objects. Crowding places a significant limit on form vision in the visual periphery; its mechanism is, however, unknown. Building on the method of signal-clamped classification images (Tjan & Nandy, 2006), we developed a series of first- and second-order classification-image techniques to investigate the nature of crowding without presupposing any model of crowding. Using an "o" versus "x" letter-identification task, we found that (1) crowding significantly reduced the contrast of first-order classification images, although it did not alter the shape of the classification images; (2) response errors during crowding were strongly correlated with the spatial structures of the flankers that resembled those of the erroneously perceived targets; (3) crowding had no systematic effect on intrinsic spatial uncertainty of an observer nor did it suppress feature detection; and (4) analysis of the second-order classification images revealed that crowding reduced the amount of valid features used by the visual system and, at the same time, increased the amount of invalid features used. Our findings strongly support the feature-mislocalization or source-confusion hypothesis as one of the proximal contributors of crowding. Our data also agree with the inappropriate feature-integration account with the requirement that feature integration be a competitive process. However, the feature-masking account and a front-end version of the spatial attention account of crowding are not supported by our data.},

	Abstract = {Crowding refers to the phenomenon in which nearby distractors impede target processing. This effect is reduced as target-distractor distance increases, and it is eliminated entirely at a distance that is labeled the critical spacing point. Attention, distractor preview, and popout are each known to facilitate processing in crowded displays. Eight experiments examined whether this is accomplished via a reduction in critical spacing. Attention was manipulated via spatial cueing, whereby a peripheral cue elicited a stimulus-driven shift of attention. Distractor preview was examined by manipulating whether the crowding distractors were presented prior to or simultaneous with the target. Popout was examined by manipulating whether there was a salient color difference between the target and distractors. As demonstrated in previous studies, we found robust benefits of spatial cueing, preview, and popout in crowded displays. However, although spatial cueing led to robust improvements in target discrimination, there was no reduction in critical spacing for attended stimuli. By contrast, both preview and popout caused large reductions in critical spacing. These disparate results indicate that attention improves target discrimination in crowded displays in a qualitatively different manner than do the other factors.},

@article{Petrov:2007ef,
	Abstract = {The abundant literature on crowding offers fairly simple explanations for the phenomenon, such as position uncertainty or feature pooling, but convincing evidence to support these explanations is lacking. In part, this is because the stimuli used for crowding studies are usually letters or other complex shapes, which makes it hard to determine exactly what kind of information is lost. In our experiment, we asked observers to identify simultaneously the slants (left or right) of three horizontally aligned Gabor targets. The targets were presented at 6 degrees in the periphery, and their size and separation were chosen to incur strong crowding. The loss of information about the position or orientation of individual members of the Gabor triads does not explain our results. Instead, crowding appears to be a particular form of collective information loss. Firstly, the outmost target was crowded much less than the other targets, which rules out explanations based on simple pooling and shows that crowding has a pronounced foveal directionality. Secondly, the specific pattern of confusion shown by all the observers indicates that the only reliable information available to them was orientation contrast, that is, the number (and, to a lesser degree, the location) of sites where slant changed. Thus, crowding appears to spare only the most salient peripheral information, which supports the hypothesis that crowding is caused by limitations of attentional resolution.},

	Abstract = {Evidence that the detection of first- and second-order visual stimuli is processed by separate pathways abounds. This study asked whether first- and second-order stimuli remain independent at the stage of processing where crowding occurs. We measured thresholds for identifying a first-order (luminance defined) or second-order (contrast defined) target letter in the presence of two second- or first-order flanking letters. For comparison, we also measured thresholds when the target and flanking letters were all first or second order. Contrast of the flankers was 1.6 times their respective contrast thresholds. Measurements were obtained at the fovea and 10 degrees in the lower visual field of four normally sighted observers. Two observers were also tested at 10 degrees nasal visual field. As expected, in both the fovea and periphery, the magnitude of crowding (threshold elevation) was maximal at the closest letter separation and decreased as letter separation increased. The magnitude of crowding was greater for second- than for first-order target letters, independent of the order type of flankers; however, the critical distance for crowding was similar for first- and second-order letters. Substantial crossover crowding occurred when the target and flanking letters were of different order type. Our finding of substantial interaction between first- and second-order stimuli suggests that the processing of these stimuli is not independent at the stage of processing at which crowding occurs.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the effect of varying interstimulus spacing on an upright among inverted face search and a red-green among green-red bisected disk search. Both tasks are classic examples of serial search; however, spacing affects them very differently: As spacing increased, face discrimination performance improved significantly, whereas performance on the bisected disks remained poor. (No effect of spacing was observed for either a red among green or an L among + search tasks, two classic examples of parallel search.) In a second experiment, we precued the target location so that attention was no longer a limiting factor: Both serial search tasks were now equally affected by spacing, a result we attribute to a more classical form of crowding. The observed spacing effect in visual search suggests that for certain tasks, serial search may result from local neuronal competition between target and distractors, soliciting attentional resources; in other cases, serial search must occur for another reason, for example, because an item-by-item, attention-mediated recognition must take place. We speculate that this distinction may be based on whether or not there exist neuronal populations tuned to the relevant target-distractor distinction, and we discuss the possible relations between this spacing effect in visual search and other forms of crowding.},

	Abstract = {Crowding and surround suppression share many similarities, which suggests the possibility of a common mechanism. Despite decades of research, there has been little effort to compare the two phenomena in a consistent fashion. A recent study by D. M. Levi, S. Hariharan, and S. A. Klein (2002) argues that the two are unrelated because crowding effects can be much stronger than suppression effects. Here we report experiments in which the same Gabor target was used both for orientation identification (crowding) and contrast detection (suppression) tasks. In agreement with early crowding studies (e.g., H. Bouma, 1973) we found, that an outward mask is much more effective than an inward mask for the orientation identification task. Notably, no such anisotropy was observed for the contrast detection task, commonly used to measure surround suppression. The anisotropic masking, which defines crowding, is observed only at fine scales (roughly within an octave of the acuity limit), whereas surround suppression is observed at all scales. Our results demonstrate that surround suppression and crowding are indeed two distinct phenomena. We used this characteristic anisotropy to show that a popular crowding paradigm in which target contrast is varied to measure crowding is confounding it with surround suppression. Surround suppression apparently dominates at low contrasts, which would explain some of the reported similarities between the two phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Crowding is impairment of peripheral object identification by nearby objects. Critical spacing (the minimum target-flanker distance that does not produce crowding) scales with target eccentricity and is consistently reported as roughly equal to or less than 50% of target eccentricity (0.5e). This study demonstrates that crowding occurs far beyond the typical critical spacing when the target is weakly masked by a surrounding contour or backwards pattern mask. A target was presented at a peripheral location on every trial and participants reported its orientation. Flankers appeared at target-flanker distances of 0.3-0.7e, or were absent. The target was presented with or without a mask. When flankers were absent, the masks only mildly impaired performance. When flankers were present but the mask was absent, target identification was nearly perfect at wide target-flanker distances (0.5e-0.7e). However, when flankers were present and the target was masked, performance dropped significantly, even when target-flanker distances far exceeded the typical crowding range. This phenomenon ("supercrowding") shares critical features with standard crowding: flankers similar to the target impair performance more than dissimilar flankers, and the characteristic anisotropic profile of crowding is preserved. Supercrowding may reflect a general interaction between crowding and other forms of masking.},

	Abstract = {In crowding, neighboring elements impair the perception of a peripherally presented target. Crowding is often regarded to be a consequence of spatial pooling of information that leads to the perception of textural wholes. We studied the effects of stimulus configuration on crowding using Gabor stimuli. In accordance with previous studies, contrast and orientation discrimination of a Gabor target were impaired in the presence of flanking Gabors of equal length. The stimulus configuration was then changed (1) by making the flankers either shorter or longer than the target or (2) by constructing each flanker from two or three small Gabors. These simple configural changes greatly reduced or even abolished crowding, even though the orientation, spatial frequency, and phase of the stimuli were unchanged. The results challenge simple pooling explanations for crowding. We propose that crowding is weak whenever the target stands out from the stimulus array and strong when the target groups with the flanking elements to form a coherent texture.},

@article{Chakravarthi:2007wq,
	Abstract = {If the target in a crowding display differs from the distracters in its contrast polarity, the extent of crowding is reduced compared to the condition where all the elements in the display have the same polarity. In Experiment 1, we test the temporal properties of this polarity advantage by reversing the contrast of the target and flankers at four frequencies between 2 and 15 Hz. In the same polarity condition, target and distracters were all white in one frame but all black in the next. In the opposite polarity condition, the target was white and distracters black in one frame and all reversed in the next frame. Less crowding was seen for the opposite polarity condition at lower frequencies, but this advantage disappeared at 7.5 Hz and higher frequencies. In Experiment 2, we test whether this result can be explained by lateral masking, using a display that matched the crowding configuration. Lateral masking did not exhibit a polarity advantage at any frequency. Hence, the polarity advantage in crowding, and its loss at 6-8 Hz, cannot be attributed to lateral masking. It is known that attention has a coarse temporal resolution (6-8 Hz). The findings of this study suggest a role for attention in crowding, as opposed to low-level mechanisms like lateral masking.},

	Abstract = {The crowding effect is a ubiquitous phenomenon in spatial perception that has been extensively investigated. A notable property of spatial crowding is the radial and tangential asymmetry in which crowding is much more severe for items arranged on a radial line originating from the fixation point compared with items arranged tangentially with regard to the fixation point. Here, we report another asymmetric property of the crowding effect between horizontally and vertically arranged spatial layouts. In multiple experiments using a number of different stimulus patterns (e.g., letter Cs, letter Ts, and parallel/nonparallel line segments), results consistently showed that the crowding effect was significantly stronger when the target and distractors were horizontally rather than vertically arranged. Such a horizontal versus vertical asymmetry was found in all four quadrants of visual space. Importantly, a further visual acuity test did not reveal a horizontal versus vertical asymmetric effect.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation to first-order (luminance defined) motion produces not only a motion aftereffect but also a position aftereffect, in which a target pattern's perceived location is shifted opposite the direction of adaptation. These aftereffects can occur passively (when the direction of motion adaptation cannot be detected) and remotely (when the target is not at the site of adaptation). Although second-order (contrast defined) motion produces these aftereffects, it is unclear whether they can occur passively or remotely. To address these questions, we conducted two experiments. In the first, we used crowding to remove a local adapter's second-order motion from awareness and still found a significant position aftereffect. In the second experiment, we found that the direction of motion in one region of a crowded array could produce a position aftereffect in an unadapted, spatially separated region of the crowded array. The results suggest that second-order motion influences perceived position over a large spatial range even without awareness.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying crowding are analyzed in terms of explicit neural processes mediating its perceptual characteristics as originally described by W. Korte (1923). A full understanding of crowding in letter recognition requires a detailed conceptualization of the process of recognition among large numbers of alternatives. The observed masking properties suggest the operation of recursive inhibition from V3 to V1 as a component of the crowding effect. The plausibility of six accounts of the neural basis of crowding (the template matching, feature integrator, attentional feature conjunction, propositional enumeration, attentional tracking, and relaxation network concepts) is then assessed in relation to the task of encoding the spatial structure of the letter forms. We conclude that the relaxation network approach is the most plausible hypothesis to account for the full-spectrum letter recognition performance.},

	Abstract = {Visual clutter concerns designers of user interfaces and information visualizations. This should not surprise visual perception researchers because excess and/or disorganized display items can cause crowding, masking, decreased recognition performance due to occlusion, greater difficulty at both segmenting a scene and performing visual search, and so on. Given a reliable measure of the visual clutter in a display, designers could optimize display clutter. Furthermore, a measure of visual clutter could help generalize models like Guided Search (J. M. Wolfe, 1994) by providing a substitute for "set size" more easily computable on more complex and natural imagery. In this article, we present and test several measures of visual clutter, which operate on arbitrary images as input. The first is a new version of the Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter presented in R. Rosenholtz, Y. Li, S. Mansfield, and Z. Jin (2005). This Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter is based on the analogy that the more cluttered a display or scene is, the more difficult it would be to add a new item that would reliably draw attention. A second measure of visual clutter, Subband Entropy, is based on the notion that clutter is related to the visual information in the display. Finally, we test a third measure, Edge Density, used by M. L. Mack and A. Oliva (2004) as a measure of subjective visual complexity. We explore the use of these measures as stand-ins for set size in visual search models and demonstrate that they correlate well with search performance in complex imagery. This includes the search-in-clutter displays of J. M. Wolfe, A. Oliva, T. S. Horowitz, S. Butcher, and A. Bompas (2002) and Bravo and Farid (2004), as well as new search experiments. An additional experiment suggests that color variability, accounted for by Feature Congestion but not the Edge Density measure or the Subband Entropy measure, does matter for visual clutter.},

	Abstract = {Bouma's law of crowding predicts an uncrowded central window through which we can read and a crowded periphery through which we cannot. The old discovery that readers make several fixations per second, rather than a continuous sweep across the text, suggests that reading is limited by the number of letters that can be acquired in one fixation, without moving one's eyes. That "visual span" has been measured in various ways, but remains unexplained. Here we show (1) that the visual span is simply the number of characters that are not crowded and (2) that, at each vertical eccentricity, reading rate is proportional to the uncrowded span. We measure rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading rate for text, in both original and scrambled word order, as a function of size and spacing at central and peripheral locations. As text size increases, reading rate rises abruptly from zero to maximum rate. This classic reading rate curve consists of a cliff and a plateau, characterized by two parameters, critical print size and maximum reading rate. Joining two ideas from the literature explains the whole curve. These ideas are Bouma's law of crowding and Legge's conjecture that reading rate is proportional to visual span. We show that Legge's visual span is the uncrowded span predicted by Bouma's law. This result joins Bouma and Legge to explain reading rate's dependence on letter size and spacing. Well-corrected fluent observers reading ordinary text with adequate light are limited by letter spacing (crowding), not size (acuity). More generally, it seems that this account holds true, independent of size, contrast, and luminance, provided only that text contrast is at least four times the threshold contrast for an isolated letter. For any given spacing, there is a central uncrowded span through which we read. This uncrowded span model explains the shape of the reading rate curve. We test the model in several ways. We use a "silent substitution" technique to measure the uncrowded span during reading. These substitutions spoil letter identification but are undetectable when the letters are crowded. Critical spacing is the smallest distance between letters that avoids crowding. We find that the critical spacing for letter identification predicts both the critical spacing and the span for reading. Thus, crowding predicts the parameters that characterize both the cliff and the plateau of the reading rate curve. Previous studies have found worrisome differences across observers and laboratories in the measured peripheral reading rates for ordinary text, which may reflect differences in print exposure, but we find that reading rate is much more consistent when word order is scrambled. In all conditions tested--all sizes and spacings, central and peripheral, ordered and scrambled--reading is limited by crowding. For each observer, at each vertical eccentricity, reading rate is proportional to the uncrowded span.},

	Abstract = {Processes underlying crowding in visual letter recognition were examined by investigating effects of training. Experiment 1 revealed that training reduces crowding mainly for trained strings. This was corroborated in Experiment 2, where no training effects were obvious after 3 days of training when strings changed from trial to trial. Experiment 3 specified that after a short amount of training, learning effects remained specific to trained strings and also to the trained retinal eccentricity and the interletter spacing used in training. Transfer to other than trained conditions was observed only after further training. Experiment 4 showed that transfer occurred earlier when words were used as stimuli. These results thus demonstrate that part of crowding results from the absence of higher level representations of the stimulus. Such representations can be acquired through learning visual properties of the stimulus.},

@article{Levi:2007vl,
	Abstract = {We measure acuity, crowding, and reading in amblyopic observers to answer four questions. (1) Is reading with the amblyopic eye impaired because of larger required letter size (i.e., worse acuity) or larger required spacing (i.e., worse crowding)? The size or spacing required to read at top speed is called "critical". For each eye of seven amblyopic observers and the preferred eyes of two normal observers, we measure reading rate as a function of the center-to-center spacing of the letters in central and peripheral vision. From these results, we estimate the critical spacing for reading. We also measured traditional acuity for an isolated letter and the critical spacing for identifying a letter among other letters, which is the classic measure of crowding. For both normals and amblyopes, in both central and peripheral vision, we find that the critical spacing for reading equals the critical spacing for crowding. The identical critical spacings, and very different critical sizes, show that crowding, not acuity, limits reading. (2) Does amblyopia affect peripheral reading? No. We find that amblyopes read normally with their amblyopic eye except that abnormal crowding in the fovea prevents them from reading fine print. (3) Is the normal periphery a good model for the amblyopic fovea? No. Reading centrally, the amblyopic eye has an abnormally large critical spacing but reads all larger spacings at normal rates. This is unlike the normal periphery, in which both critical spacing and maximum reading rate are severely impaired relative to the normal fovea. (4) Can the uncrowded-span theory of reading rate explain amblyopic reading? Yes. The case of amblyopia shows that crowding limits reading solely by determining the uncrowded span: the number of characters that are not crowded. Characters are uncrowded if and only if their spacing is more than critical. The text spacing may be uniform, but the observer's critical spacing increases with distance from fixation, so the uncrowded span extends out to where the spacing is critical. Amblyopes have normal critical spacing in the periphery, so, when the uncrowded span extends into the periphery, it has normal extent, which predicts our finding that reading rate is normal too. This confirms the theory that reading rate is determined by the width of the uncrowded span, independent of the critical spacing within the span. The uncrowded-span model of normal reading fits the amblyopic results well, with a roughly fivefold increase in the critical spacing at fixation. Thus, the entire amblyopic reading deficit is accounted for by crowding.},

	Abstract = {Crowding occurs when nearby flankers jumble the appearance of a target object, making it hard to identify. Crowding is feature integration over an inappropriately large region. What determines the size of that region? According to bottom-up proposals, the size is that of an anatomically determined isolation field. According to top-down proposals, the size is that of the spotlight of attention. Intriligator and Cavanagh (2001) proposed the latter, but we show that their conclusion rests on an implausible assumption. Here we investigate the role of attention in crowding using the change blindness paradigm. We measure capacity for widely and narrowly spaced letters during a change detection task, both with and without an interstimulus cue. We find that standard crowding manipulations-reducing spacing and adding flankers-severely impair uncued change detection but have no effect on cued change detection. Because crowded letters look less familiar, we must use longer internal descriptions (less compact representations) to remember them. Thus, fewer fit into working memory. The memory limit does not apply to the cued condition because the observer need remember only the cued letter. Cued performance escapes the effects of crowding, as predicted by a top-down account. However, our most parsimonious account of the results is bottom-up: Cued change detection is so easy that the observer can tolerate feature degradation and letter distortion, making the observer immune to crowding. The change detection task enhances the classic partial report paradigm by making the test easier (same/different instead of identifying one of many possible targets), which increases its sensitivity, so it can reveal degraded memory traces.},

	Abstract = {Several recent studies have related crowding with the feature integration stage in visual processing. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in this stage, it is important to use stimuli that have several features to integrate, and these features should be clearly defined and measurable. In this study, Gabor patches were used as target and distractor stimuli. The stimuli differed in three dimensions: spatial frequency, orientation, and color. A group of 3, 5, or 7 objects was presented briefly at 4 deg eccentricity of the visual field. The observers' task was to identify the object located in the center of the group. A strong effect of the number of distractors was observed, consistent with various spatial pooling models. The analysis of incorrect responses revealed that these were a mix of feature errors and mislocalizations of the target object. Feature errors were not purely random, but biased by the features of distractors. We propose a simple feature integration model that predicts most of the observed regularities.},

@article{Louie:2007hb,
	Abstract = {It is difficult to recognize an object that falls in the peripheral visual field; it is even more difficult when there are other objects surrounding it. This effect, known as crowding, could be due to interactions between the low-level parts or features of the surrounding objects. Here, we investigated whether crowding can also occur selectively between higher level object representations. Many studies have demonstrated that upright faces, unlike most other objects, are coded holistically. Therefore, in addition to featural crowding within a face (M. Martelli, N. J. Majaj, & D. G. Pelli, 2005), we might expect an additional crowding effect between upright faces due to interference between the higher level holistic representations of these faces. In a series of experiments, we tested this by presenting an upright target face in a crowd of additional upright or inverted faces. We found that recognition was more strongly impaired when the target face was surrounded by upright compared to inverted flanker (distractor) faces; this pattern of results was absent when inverted faces and non-face objects were used as targets. This selective crowding of upright faces by other upright faces only occurred when the target-flanker separation was less than half the eccentricity of the target face, consistent with traditional crowding effects (H. Bouma, 1970; D. G. Pelli, M. Palomares, & N. J. Majaj, 2004). Likewise, the selective interference between upright faces did not occur at the fovea and was not a function of the target-flanker similarity, suggesting that crowding-specific processes were responsible. The results demonstrate that crowding can occur selectively between high-level representations of faces and may therefore occur at multiple stages in the visual system.},

	Abstract = {We describe several experiments on contour interactions and crowding effects at the resolution limit of the visual system. As test stimuli we used characters that are often employed in optometric practice for testing visual acuity: Landolt C's, Snellen E's, and rectangular gratings. We tested several hypotheses that have been put forward to explain contour interaction and crowding effects. In Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, Landolt C's were the test stimuli, and bars, or Landolt C's, or gratings served as distractors. In Experiment 1, we showed that neither scale invariance nor spatial frequency selectivity is a characteristic of foveal crowding effects. These results allowed us to conclude that mechanisms other than lateral masking contribute to observers' performance in 'crowded' tasks. R. F. Hess, S. C. Dakin, and N. Kappor (2000) suggested that the spatial frequency band most appropriate for target recognition is shifted by the surrounding bars to higher spatial frequencies that cannot be resolved by observers. Our Experiment 2 rejects this hypothesis as the experimental data do not follow theoretical predictions. In Experiment 3, we employed Snellen E's, both as test stimuli and as distractors. The masking functions were similar to those measured in Experiment 1 when the test Landolt C was surrounded by Landolt C's. In Experiment 4, we extended the range of test stimuli to rectangular gratings; same-frequency or high-frequency gratings were distractors. In this case, if the distracting gratings had random orientation from trial to trial, the critical spacing was twice larger than in the first three experiments. If the orientation of the distractors was fixed during the whole experiment, the critical spacing was similar to that measured in the first three experiments. We suggest that the visual system can use different mechanisms for the discrimination of different test stimuli in the presence of particular surround. Different receptive fields with different spatial characteristics can be employed. To explain why crowding effects at the resolution limit of the visual system are not scale invariant, we suggest that a range of stimuli, slightly varying in size, may all be processed by the same neural channel--the channel with the smallest receptive fields of the visual system.},

@article{Levi:2002ph,
	Abstract = {Spatial interactions are a critical and ubiquitous feature of spatial vision. These interactions may be inhibitory (reducing sensitivity as occurs in crowding) or facilitatory (enhancing sensitivity). In this work, we had four goals. 1. To test the hypothesis that foveal crowding depends on target size by measuring the extent of crowding for novel targets that were limited in their spatial frequency content. We used a large range of target sizes and spatial frequencies. 2. To assess whether the critical spatial frequency model (Hess, Dakin, & Kapoor, 2000) provides a general model for foveal crowding. To test this model, we measured crowding for a direction-identification task that did not require judging the orientation of the gap. 3. To test the hypothesis that foveal crowding is simply contrast masking by remote flanks we measured and compared crowding in a direction-identification experiment with masking by remote flanks in a detection experiment. In each of the experiments, our targets and flanks were composed of Gabor features, thus allowing us to control the feature contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation. 4. To assess the relationship between suppressive and facilitatory spatial interactions in foveal vision. Our results show that (1) foveal crowding is proportional to feature size over the more than 50-fold range of target sizes that we examined. Over this large range, foveal crowding is scale invariant. Our results also show it is the size of the envelope (SD) rather than the carrier (SF) that determines the extent of crowding in the fovea. 2. Crowding that occurs in the direction-identification task is quite similar to crowding where orientation information is available. Thus we conclude that the critical spatial frequency model does not provide a general explanation for foveal crowding. 3. Threshold elevation for crowding is similar to threshold elevation for masking as predicted by our test-pedestal model. Thus we conclude that foveal crowding is simple contrast masking. 4. Based on our comparison of threshold changes in crowding and masking, we conclude that in foveal vision, the suppressive spatial interactions due to nearby flanks are similar in the two tasks. However, the facilitatory interactions are quite different. In the crowding task, we find very little evidence for facilitation by flankers, whereas in the detection task, we find strong facilitation. We suggest that facilitation of detection by remote flanks may be, at least in part, a consequence of uncertainty reduction.},

	Abstract = {Perception of peripherally viewed shapes is impaired when surrounded by similar shapes. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "crowding". Although studied extensively for perception of characters (mainly letters) and, to a lesser extent, for orientation, little is known about whether and how crowding affects perception of other features. Nevertheless, current crowding models suggest that the effect should be rather general and thus not restricted to letters and orientation. Here, we report on a series of experiments investigating crowding in the following elementary feature dimensions: size, hue, and saturation. Crowding effects in these dimensions were benchmarked against those in the orientation domain. Our primary finding is that all features studied show clear signs of crowding. First, identification thresholds increase with decreasing mask spacing. Second, for all tested features, critical spacing appears to be roughly half the viewing eccentricity and independent of stimulus size, a property previously proposed as the hallmark of crowding. Interestingly, although critical spacings are highly comparable, crowding magnitude differs across features: Size crowding is almost as strong as orientation crowding, whereas the effect is much weaker for saturation and hue. We suggest that future theories and models of crowding should be able to accommodate these differences in crowding effects.},

	Abstract = {During the last decades, research on binary decision making elucidated some of the basic neural mechanisms underlying the decision-making process. Recently, the focus of experimental as well as modeling studies began to shift from simple binary choices to decision making with multiple alternatives. In this article, we address the question how different numbers of choice alternatives might be handled and encoded in the brain. We present a minimal, biophysically realistic spiking neuron model for decision making with multiple alternatives. Our model accounts for the relevant aspects of recent experimental data of a random-dot motion-discrimination task on both the cellular and behavioral level. Notably, all network parameters and inputs in our network are independent of the number of possible alternatives used in the tested experimental paradigms (2 and 4 alternatives and 2 alternatives with an angular separation of 90 degrees ). This avoids the use of extra top-down regulation mechanisms to adapt the network to the number of choices. Furthermore, we show that increasing the number of neurons encoding each choice alternative is positively related to the network's capacity of choice-number-independent decision making. Consequently, our results suggest a physiological advantage of a pooled, multineuron representation of choice alternatives.},

We argue that the variety and complexity of the results reported in the literature emerge from the variety of empirical protocols that were used, such that the results observed in any one experiment depended on the stimulus conditions and the subject's attentional strategy, a notion that we define precisely in terms of the attention field in the model, but that has not typically been completely under experimental control.},

	Abstract = {Cortical areas differ in their patterns of connectivity, cellular composition, and functional architecture. Spike trains, on the other hand, are commonly assumed to follow similarly irregular dynamics across neocortex. We examined spike-time statistics in four parietal areas using a method that accounts for nonstationarities in firing rate. We found that, whereas neurons in visual areas fire irregularly, many cells in association and motor-like parietal regions show increasingly regular spike trains by comparison. Regularity was evident both in the shape of interspike interval distributions and in spike-count variability across trials. Thus, Poisson-like randomness is not a universal feature of neocortex. Rather, many parietal cells have reduced trial-to-trial variability in spike counts that could provide for more reliable firing-rate signals. These results suggest that spiking dynamics may play different roles in different cortical areas and should not be assumed to arise from fundamentally irreducible noise sources.},

	Abstract = {We recently showed that improved perceptual performance on a visual motion direction-discrimination task corresponds to changes in how an unmodified sensory representation in the brain is interpreted to form a decision that guides behavior. Here we found that these changes can be accounted for using a reinforcement-learning rule to shape functional connectivity between the sensory and decision neurons. We modeled performance on the basis of the readout of simulated responses of direction-selective sensory neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of monkey cortex. A reward prediction error guided changes in connections between these sensory neurons and the decision process, first establishing the association between motion direction and response direction, and then gradually improving perceptual sensitivity by selectively strengthening the connections from the most sensitive neurons in the sensory population. The results suggest a common, feedback-driven mechanism for some forms of associative and perceptual learning.},

@article{Derrington:1984vm,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the analysis of the chromatic properties of neurones, and applies it to cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) of macaque. The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a 'constant B' axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue-sensitive (B) cones, a 'constant R & G' axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red-sensitive (R) or green-sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the 'constant B' and 'constant R & G' axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0-180 deg, and the constant R & G axis the azimuth 90-270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (-90 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this 'null plane' provides the 'signature' of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R-G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the primary thalamic nucleus that relays visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1) and has been extensively studied in non-human primates. A key feature of the LGN is the segregation of retinal inputs into different cellular layers characterized by their differential responses to red-green (RG) color (L/M opponent), blue-yellow (BY) color (S-cone opponent) and achromatic (Ach) contrast. In this study we use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (4 tesla, 3.6 x 3.6 x 3 mm(3)) to record simultaneously the responses of the human LGN and V1 to chromatic and Ach contrast to investigate the LGN responses to color, and how these are modified as information transfers between LGN and cortex. We find that the LGN has a robust response to RG color contrast, equal to or greater than the Ach response, but a significantly poorer sensitivity to BY contrast. In V1 at low temporal rates (2 Hz), however, the sensitivity of the BY color pathway is selectively enhanced, rising in relation to the RG and Ach responses. We find that this effect generalizes across different stimulus contrasts and spatial stimuli (1-d and 2-d patterns), but is selective for temporal frequency, as it is not found for stimuli at 8 Hz. While the mechanism of this cortical enhancement of BY color vision and its dynamic component is unknown, its role may be to compensate for a weak BY signal originating from the sparse distribution of neurons in the retina and LGN.},

	Abstract = {Colour vision in humans and Old World monkeys begins with the differential activation of three types of cone photoreceptor which are maximally sensitive to short (S), medium (M) and long (L) wavelengths. Signals from the three cone types are relayed to the retinal ganglion cells via cone-specific bipolar cell types. Colour-coding ganglion cells fall into two major physiological classes: the red-green opponent cells, which receive antagonistic input from M- and L-sensitive cones, and the blue-yellow opponent cells, which receive input from S-sensitive cones, opposed by combined M- and L-cone input. The neural mechanisms producing colour opponency are not understood. It has been assumed that both kinds of opponent signals are transmitted to the lateral geniculate nucleus by one type of ganglion cell, the midget cell. We now report that a distinct non-midget ganglion cell type, the small bistratified cell, corresponds to the physiological type that receives excitatory input from S cones, the 'blue-on' cell. Our results thus demonstrate an anatomically distinct pathway that conveys S-cone signals to the brain. The morphology of the blue-on cell also suggests a novel hypothesis for the retinal circuitry underlying the blue-yellow opponent response.},

@article{Szmajda:2008rb,
	Abstract = {To understand the transmission of sensory signals in visual pathways we studied the morphology and central projection of ganglion cell populations in marmoset monkeys. Retinal ganglion cells were labeled by photofilling following injections of retrograde tracer in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), or by intracellular injection with neurobiotin. Ganglion cell morphology was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition to midget and parasol ganglion cells, this method distinguished three main clusters of wide-field cells that correspond to small bistratified, sparse, and broad thorny cells identified previously. The small bistratified and sparse cells occupy neighboring positions on the hierarchical (linkage distance) tree. These cell types are presumed to carry signals originating in short-wavelength sensitive (S or "blue") cones in the retina. The linkage distance from these putative S-cone pathway ganglion cells to other wide-field cells is similar to the linkage distance from midget cells to parasol cells, suggesting that S-cone cells form a distinct functional subgroup of ganglion cells. Small bistratified cells and large sparse cells were the most commonly labeled wide-field cells following LGN injections in koniocellular layer K3. This is consistent with physiological evidence that the role of this layer includes transmission of S-cone signals to the visual cortex. Other wide-field cell types were also labeled following injections including K3, and other koniocellular LGN layers; these cell types may correspond to "non-blue koniocellular" receptive fields recorded in physiological studies.},

	Abstract = {How is the trichromatic cone mosaic of Old World primates sampled by retinal circuits to create wavelength opponency? Red-green (L versus M cone) opponency appears to be mediated largely by the segregation of L versus M cone signals to the centre versus the surround of the midget ganglion cell receptive field, implying a complex cone type-specific wiring, the basis of which remains mysterious. Blue-yellow (S versus L+M cone) opponency is mediated by a growing family of low-density ganglion types that receive either excitatory or inhibitory input from S cones. Thus, the retinal circuits that underlie colour signalling in primates may be both more complex and more diverse then previously appreciated.},

	Abstract = {We derived the cone fundamentals for X-chromosome-linked anomalous trichromats for the wavelength range of 400-700 nm. Pigment templates were constructed from the cone fundamentals of normal trichromats after correction for ocular media absorption. The resultant retinal-level sensitivities had small irregularities in the short-wavelength region that were smoothed. The pigment templates, expressed as quantal sensitivities, were then shifted on a frequency abscissa to solve for the lambda max of the pigments of anomalous trichromats needed to predict average anomaloscope matching data. We found that the protanomalous M- and L'-cone pigments are separated by 10 nm and the deuteranomalous M'- and L-cone pigments are separated by 6 nm (rounded to the nearest nanometer), where M and L indicate middle- and long-wavelength sensitive, respectively. The triads of peak wavelengths for the corneal energy-based sensitivities were as follows: normal: 440, 543, and 566 nm; protanomalous: 440, 543, and 553 nm; and deuteranomalous: 440, 560, and 566 nm.},

	Abstract = {The CIE chromaticity diagram, which has been in common use for more than 60 years, disguises essential relations among cone excitations that become transparent in a system developed with D. I. A. MacLeod and initially proposed by the author to the CIE in 1979. This proposal led to the formation of a CIE committee to consider an ideal version of the system, to be employed either as a supplement to, or an alternative for, the 1931 "standard observer". After 15 years, the task remains unfinished. The history of debate within the original committee and that of its successor (which is still active today) is briefly reviewed. Among cone fundamentals that might be chosen, a set derived and published by Stockman, MacLeod, and Johnson [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 10, 2491 (1993)] is favored here, and some of the advantages for displaying visual data in a system based on these fundamentals are illustrated.},

@article{Curcio:1990fc,
	Abstract = {We have measured the spatial density of cones and rods in eight whole-mounted human retinas, obtained from seven individuals between 27 and 44 years of age, and constructed maps of photoreceptor density and between-individual variability. The average human retina contains 4.6 million cones (4.08-5.29 million). Peak foveal cone density averages 199,000 cones/mm2 and is highly variable between individuals (100,000-324,000 cones/mm2). The point of highest density may be found in an area as large as 0.032 deg2. Cone density falls steeply with increasing eccentricity and is an order of magnitude lower 1 mm away from the foveal center. Superimposed on this gradient is a streak of high cone density along the horizontal meridian. At equivalent eccentricities, cone density is 40-45% higher in nasal compared to temporal retina and slightly higher in midperipheral inferior compared to superior retina. Cone density also increases slightly in far nasal retina. The average human retina contains 92 million rods (77.9-107.3 million). In the fovea, the average horizontal diameter of the rod-free zone is 0.350 mm (1.25 degrees). Foveal rod density increases most rapidly superiorly and least rapidly nasally. The highest rod densities are located along an elliptical ring at the eccentricity of the optic disk and extending into nasal retina with the point of highest density typically in superior retina (5/6 eyes). Rod densities decrease by 15-25% where the ring crosses the horizontal meridian. Rod density declines slowly from the rod ring to the far periphery and is highest in nasal and superior retina. Individual variability in photoreceptor density differs with retinal region and is similar for both cones and rods. Variability is highest near the fovea, reaches a minimum in the midperiphery, and then increases with eccentricity to the ora serrata. The total number of foveal cones is similar for eyes with widely varying peak cone density, consistent with the idea that the variability reflects differences in the lateral migration of photoreceptors during development. Two fellow eyes had cone and rod numbers within 8% and similar but not identical photoreceptor topography.},

	Abstract = {1. Spectral sensitivities of cones in the retina of cynomolgus monkeys were determined by recording photocurrents from single outer segments with a suction electrode. 2. The amplitude and shape of the response to a flash depended upon the number of photons absorbed but not the wave-length, so that the 'Principle of Univariance' was obeyed. 3. Spectra were obtained from five 'blue', twenty 'green', and sixteen 'red' cones. The wave-lengths of maximum sensitivity were approximately 430, 531 and 561 nm, respectively. 4. The spectra of the three types of cones had similar shapes when plotted on a log wave number scale, and were fitted by an empirical expression. 5. There was no evidence for the existence of subclasses of cones with different spectral sensitivities. Within a class, the positions of the individual spectra on the wave-length axis showed a standard deviation of less than 1.5 nm. 6. Psychophysical results on human colour matching (Stiles & Burch, 1955; Stiles & Burch, 1959) were well predicted from the spectral sensitivities of the monkey cones. After correction for pre-retinal absorption and pigment self-screening, the spectra of the red and green cones matched the respective pi 5 and pi 4 mechanisms of Stiles (1953, 1959).},

@article{Connolly:2009jw,
	Abstract = {In subjects trained extensively to indicate a perceptual decision with an action, neural commands that generate the action can represent the process of forming the decision. However, it is unknown whether this representation requires overtraining or reflects a more general link between perceptual and motor processing. We examined how perceptual processing is represented in motor commands in naive monkeys being trained on a demanding perceptual task, as they first establish the sensory-motor association and then learn to form more accurate perceptual judgments. The task required the monkeys to decide the direction of random-dot motion and respond with an eye movement to one of two visual targets. Using electrically evoked saccades, we examined oculomotor commands that developed during motion viewing. Throughout training, these commands tended to reflect both the subsequent binary choice of saccade target and the weighing of graded motion evidence used to arrive at that choice. Moreover, these decision-related oculomotor signals, along with the time needed to initiate the voluntary saccadic response, changed steadily as training progressed, approximately matching concomitant improvements in behavioral sensitivity to the motion stimulus. Thus, motor circuits may have general access to perceptual processing used to select between actions, even without extensive training. The results also suggest a novel candidate mechanism for some forms of perceptual learning, in which the brain learns rapidly to treat a perceptual decision as a problem of action selection and then over time to use sensory input more effectively to guide the selection process. },

@article{Britten:1996bf,
	Abstract = {We have previously documented the exquisite motion sensitivity of neurons in extrastriate area MT by studying the relationship between their responses and the direction and strength of visual motion signals delivered to their receptive fields. These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based.},

@article{Nienborg:2009it,
	Abstract = {During perceptual decisions, the activity of sensory neurons correlates with a subject's percept, even when the physical stimulus is identical. The origin of this correlation is unknown. Current theory proposes a causal effect of noise in sensory neurons on perceptual decisions, but the correlation could result from different brain states associated with the perceptual choice (a top-down explanation). These two schemes have very different implications for the role of sensory neurons in forming decisions. Here we use white-noise analysis to measure tuning functions of V2 neurons associated with choice and simultaneously measure how the variation in the stimulus affects the subjects' (two macaques) perceptual decisions. In causal models, stronger effects of the stimulus upon decisions, mediated by sensory neurons, are associated with stronger choice-related activity. However, we find that over the time course of the trial these measures change in different directions-at odds with causal models. An analysis of the effect of reward size also supports this conclusion. Finally, we find that choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain that are incompatible with causal models. All three results are readily explained if choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain caused by top-down phenomena that closely resemble attention. We conclude that top-down processes contribute to choice-related activity. Thus, even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions between cognitive processes and sensory neurons.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the precision of smooth pursuit eye speed can match perceptual speed discrimination thresholds during the steady-state phase of pursuit [Kowler, E., & McKee, S. (1987). Sensitivity of smooth eye movement to small differences in target velocity. Vision Research, 27, 993-1015; Gegenfurtner, K., Xing, D., Scott, B., & Hawken, M. (2003). A comparison of pursuit eye movement and perceptual performance in speed discrimination. Journal of Vision, 3, 865-876]. Recently, Osborne et al. [Osborne, L. C., Lisberger, S. G., & Bialek, W. (2005). A sensory source for motor variation. Nature, 437, 412-416; Osborne, L. C., Hohl, S. S., Bialek, W., & Lisberger S. G. (2007). Time course of precision in smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys. Journal of Neuroscience, 27, 2987-2998] claimed that pursuit precision during the initiation phase of pursuit also matches the sensory variability, implying that there is no motor noise added during pursuit initiation. However, these results were derived from a comparison of monkey pursuit data to human perceptual data from the literature, which were obtained with different stimuli. To directly compare precision for perception and pursuit, we measured pursuit and perceptual variability in the same human observers using the same stimuli. Subjects had to pursue a Gaussian blob in a step-ramp paradigm and give speed judgments on the same or in different trials. Speed discrimination thresholds were determined for different presentation durations. The analysis of pursuit precision was performed for short intervals containing the initiation period only and also for longer intervals including steady-state pursuit. In agreement with published studies, we found that the Weber fractions for psychophysical speed discrimination were fairly constant for different presentation durations, even for the shortest presentation duration of 150ms. Pursuit variability was 3-4 times as high for the analysis interval (300ms) containing the open-loop phase only. For pursuit analysis intervals of 400-500ms, pursuit variability approached perceptual variability. Our results show that, for the stimuli we used, the motor system contributes at least 50% to the total variability of smooth pursuit eye movements during the initiation phase.},

	Abstract = {Decision making with several choice options is central to cognition. To elucidate the neural mechanisms of such decisions, we investigated a recurrent cortical circuit model in which fluctuating spiking neural dynamics underlie trial-by-trial stochastic decisions. The model encodes a continuous analog stimulus feature and is thus applicable to multiple-choice decisions. Importantly, the continuous network captures similarity between alternatives and possible overlaps in their neural representation. Model simulations accounted for behavioral as well as single-unit neurophysiological data from a recent monkey experiment and revealed testable predictions about the patterns of error rate as a function of the similarity between the correct and actual choices. We also found that the similarity and number of options affect speed and accuracy of responses. A mechanism is proposed for flexible control of speed-accuracy tradeoff, based on a simple top-down signal to the decision circuit that may vary nonmonotonically with the number of choice alternatives.},

	Abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

	Abstract = {The spatial analysis of a target may be strongly degraded by the simultaneous presentation of nearby pattern elements. The present study investigated the shape and extent of the region of interaction as a function of retinal location. The stimuli consisted of 3 collinear [symbol: see text] s which were randomly oriented up ([symbol: see text]) or down ([symbol: see text]). The task was to discriminate the orientation of the middle [symbol: see text]. The retinal locations studied were at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 degrees, on the lower vertical meridian and on the nasal halves of both the horizontal and the 45 degrees diagonal visual field meridians. The extent of the interaction region was defined as the separation between the midpoint of two adjacent [symbol: see text] s that resulted in 75% correct discrimination. The shape of the interaction region was determined by using several orientations (horizontal, vertical, left diagonal and right diagonal) for the virtual line joining the 3. [symbol: see text] s. Our results show that the size of the interaction regions varies linearly with eccentricity as does the size of a just resolved individual [symbol: see text]. However, the size of the interaction region varies much more rapidly than does the resolution threshold for an individual [symbol: see text]. The spatial interaction zones appear to be elongated radially, so that they have an elliptical shape. The size of the major axis is about 2-3 times the size of the minor axis. The major axis is along the meridian through the central visual field (i.e. it is oriented radially) while the minor axis is oriented tangentially (i.e. isoeccentrically).},

	Abstract = {Both the speed and the accuracy of a perceptual judgment depend on the strength of the sensory stimulation. When stimulus strength is high, accuracy is high and response time is fast; when stimulus strength is low, accuracy is low and response time is slow. Although the psychometric function is well established as a tool for analyzing the relationship between accuracy and stimulus strength, the corresponding chronometric function for the relationship between response time and stimulus strength has not received as much consideration. In this article, we describe a theory of perceptual decision making based on a diffusion model. In it, a decision is based on the additive accumulation of sensory evidence over time to a bound. Combined with simple scaling assumptions, the proportional-rate and power-rate diffusion models predict simple analytic expressions for both the chronometric and psychometric functions. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we show that this theory accounts for response time and accuracy as a function of both stimulus strength and speed-accuracy instructions. In particular, the results demonstrate a close coupling between response time and accuracy. The theory is also shown to subsume the predictions of Pieron's Law, a power function dependence of response time on stimulus strength. The theory's analytic chronometric function allows one to extend theories of accuracy to response time.},

The aim of the present research was to show (1) how the three different hypotheses incorporate response biases into a sequential sampling decision process, (2) how payoffs and deadlines affect choice probabilities, and (3) the hypotheses' predictions of response times and choice probabilities. The two-stage-processing hypothesis gave the best account, especially for the choice probabilities, whereas the drift-rate-change hypothesis had problems predicting choice probabilities as a function of deadlines.},

	Abstract = {Much has been learned over the past 25 years about how attention influences neuronal responses to stimuli in the visual cortex of monkeys and humans. The most recent studies have used parametric manipulations of stimulus attributes such as orientation, direction of motion, and contrast to elucidate the form of the attentional mechanism. The results of these studies do not always agree. However, some of this inconsistency may be caused which attentional effects are considered, such as contrast gain, response gain, or a baseline shift in firing rate with attention. Here, seven studies of spatial and feature-based attention, ranging from monkey electrophysiological studies in V4 and MT to fMRI studies in human visual cortex, are reevaluated in the context of a single parametric model that incorporates a variety of ways in which attention can influence neuronal responses. This reanalysis shows that most, though not all, of these results can be explained by a similar combination of attentional mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {We often face alternatives that we are free to choose between. Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals.},

	Abstract = {In this report, we evaluate the role of visual areas responsive to motion in the human brain in the perception of stimulus speed. We first identified and localized V1, V3A, and V5/MT+ in individual participants on the basis of blood oxygenation level-dependent responses obtained in retinotopic mapping experiments and responses to moving gratings. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was then used to disrupt the normal functioning of the previously localized visual areas in each participant. During the rTMS application, participants were required to perform delayed discrimination of the speed of drifting or spatial frequency of static gratings. The application of rTMS to areas V5/MT and V3A induced a subjective slowing of visual stimuli and (often) caused increases in speed discrimination thresholds. Deficits in spatial frequency discrimination were not observed for applications of rTMS to V3A or V5/MT+. The induced deficits in speed perception were also specific to the cortical site of TMS delivery. The application of TMS to regions of the cortex adjacent to V5/MT and V3A, as well as to area V1, produced no deficits in speed perception. These results suggest that, in addition to area V5/MT+, V3A plays an important role in a cortical network that underpins the perception of stimulus speed in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {Computational neuroscience combines theory and experiment to shed light on the principles and mechanisms of neural computation. This approach has been highly fruitful in the ongoing effort to understand velocity computation by the primate visual system. This Review describes the success of spatiotemporal-energy models in representing local-velocity detection. It shows why local-velocity measurements tend to differ from the velocity of the object as a whole. Certain cells in the middle temporal area are thought to solve this problem by combining local-velocity estimates to compute the overall pattern velocity. The Review discusses different models for how this might occur and experiments that test these models. Although no model is yet firmly established, evidence suggests that computing pattern velocity from local-velocity estimates involves simple operations in the spatiotemporal frequency domain.},

	Abstract = {Motion from periphery to central vision (foveopetal motion) causes a greater flash-lag effect than motion in the opposite direction (foveofugal motion). In order to examine the factors that contribute to the motion direction-based anisotropic flash-lag effect, we investigated the mislocalization of the flash caused by motion and the mislocalization of the moving object per se. We observed that for foveofugal motion, flashes were perceived shifted in the direction of motion but mislocalized in the opposite direction for foveopetal motion. Additionally the mislocalization of the moving object was larger in foveopetal motion than in foveofugal motion. Thus, both factors contribute to the anisotropic flash-lag effect. We interpret these findings in terms of greater behavioral significance of foveopetal motion in relation to foveofugal motion.},

These striking reversals occur because each kind of stimulus is constructed to simultaneously activate two different mechanisms: a short-range mechanism that computes motion from space-time correspondences in stimulus luminance and a long-range mechanism in which motion computations are performed, instead, on stimulus contrast that has been full-wave rectified (e.g., on the absolute value of contrast).},

	Abstract = {Humans and other animals must often make decisions on the basis of imperfect evidence. Statisticians use measures such as P values to assign degrees of confidence to propositions, but little is known about how the brain computes confidence estimates about decisions. We explored this issue using behavioural analysis and neural recordings in rats in combination with computational modelling. Subjects were trained to perform an odour categorization task that allowed decision confidence to be manipulated by varying the distance of the test stimulus to the category boundary. To understand how confidence could be computed along with the choice itself, using standard models of decision-making, we defined a simple measure that quantified the quality of the evidence contributing to a particular decision. Here we show that the firing rates of many single neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex match closely to the predictions of confidence models and cannot be readily explained by alternative mechanisms, such as learning stimulus-outcome associations. Moreover, when tested using a delayed reward version of the task, we found that rats' willingness to wait for rewards increased with confidence, as predicted by the theoretical model. These results indicate that confidence estimates, previously suggested to require 'metacognition' and conscious awareness are available even in the rodent brain, can be computed with relatively simple operations, and can drive adaptive behaviour. We suggest that confidence estimation may be a fundamental and ubiquitous component of decision-making.},

	Abstract = {Three classes of task appear to involve time-to-contact (TTC) information: coincidence anticipa- 
tion (CA) tasks, relative judgment (RJ) tasks, and interceptive actions (IAs). An important type of CA 
task used to study the perception of TTC is the prediction-motion (PM) task. The question of whether 
it is possible to study the perceptual processes involved in the timing of IAs using PM and RJ tasks 
is considered. A revised version of the tau hypothesis is proposed as an account of the perceptual in- 
formation processing involved in the control of fast IAs. This draws on the distinction between 
``motor'' and ``cognitive'' visual systems. It is argued that task variables affect whether ``cognitive'' in- 
formation processing is involved in performance and can determine whether TTC information is used 
at all. Evidence is reviewed that suggests that PM and RJ tasks involve cognitive processing. It is ar- 
gued that target viewing time, TTC at response initiation, amount of practice, and whether there is a 
period between target disappearance and response are task variables that determine whether cog- 
nitive processing will influence responding.

	Abstract = {If the purpose of adaptation is to fit sensory systems to different environments, it may implement an optimization of the system. What the optimum is depends on the statistics of these environments. Therefore, the system should update its parameters as the environment changes. A Kalman-filtering strategy performs such an update optimally by combining current estimations of the environment with those from the past. We investigate whether the visual system uses such a strategy for speed adaptation. We performed a matching-speed experiment to evaluate the time course of adaptation to an abrupt velocity change. Experimental results are in agreement with Kalman-modeling predictions for speed adaptation. When subjects adapt to a low speed and it suddenly increases, the time course of adaptation presents two phases, namely, a rapid decrease of perceived speed followed by a slower phase. In contrast, when speed changes from fast to slow, adaptation presents a single phase. In the Kalman-model simulations, this asymmetry is due to the prevalence of low speeds in natural images. However, this asymmetry disappears both experimentally and in simulations when the adapting stimulus is noisy. In both transitions, adaptation now occurs in a single phase. Finally, the model also predicts the change in sensitivity to speed discrimination produced by the adaptation.},

	Abstract = {The external world is mapped retinotopically onto the primary visual cortex (V1). We show here that objects in the world, unless they are very dissimilar, can be recognized only if they are sufficiently separated in visual cortex: specifically, in V1, at least 6mm apart in the radial direction (increasing eccentricity) or 1mm apart in the circumferential direction (equal eccentricity). Objects closer together than this critical spacing are perceived as an unidentifiable jumble. This is called 'crowding'. It severely limits visual processing, including speed of reading and searching. The conclusion about visual cortex rests on three findings. First, psychophysically, the necessary 'critical' spacing, in the visual field, is proportional to (roughly half) the eccentricity of the objects. Second, the critical spacing is independent of the size and kind of object. Third, anatomically, the representation of the visual field on the cortical surface is such that the position in V1 (and several other areas) is the logarithm of eccentricity in the visual field. Furthermore, we show that much of this can be accounted for by supposing that each 'combining field', defined by the critical spacing measurements, is implemented by a fixed number of cortical neurons.},

@article{Qiu:2006lq,
	Abstract = { Human primary visual cortex is organized retinotopically, with adjacent locations in cortex representing adjacent locations on the retina. The spatial sampling in cortex is highly nonuniform: the amount of cortex devoted to a unit area of retina decreases with increasing retinal eccentricity. This sampling property can be quantified by the linear cortical magnification factor, which is expressed in terms of millimeters of cortex per degree of visual angle. In this paper, we present a new method using dynamic programming and fMRI retinotopic eccentricity mapping to estimate the linear cortical magnification factor in human primary visual cortex (V1). We localized cortical activity while subjects viewed each of seven stationary contrast- reversing radial checkerboard rings of equal thickness that tiled the visual field from 1.62 to 12.96 degrees of eccentricity. Imaging data from all epochs of each ring were contrasted with data from fixation epochs on a subject-by-subject basis. The resulting t statistic maps were then superimposed on a local coordinate system constructed from the gray/white matter boundary surface of each individual subject's occipital lobe, separately for each ring. Smoothed maps of functional activity on the cortical surface were constructed using orthonormal bases of the Laplace-Beltrami operator that incorporate the geometry of the cortical surface. This allowed us to stably track the ridge of maximum activation due to each ring via dynamic programming optimization over all possible paths on the cortical surface. We estimated the linear cortical magnification factor by calculating geodesic distances between activation ridges on the cortical surface in a population of five normal subjects. The reliability of these estimates was assessed by comparing results based on data from one quadrant to those based on data from the full hemifield along with a split-half reliability analysis.},

	Abstract = {The flash-lag effect refers to the phenomenon in which a flash adjacent to a continuously moving object is perceived to lag behind it. Phenomenally, the flash appears to be spatially shifted relative to the moving stimulus, and the amount of lag has often been quantified as the flash's nulling position, which is the physical spatial offset needed to establish perceptual alignment. The present study offers a better way to summarize flash-lag data. Instead of plotting data in terms of space, the psychometric function of the observer's relative-position judgment is drawn on spatiotemporal plot. The psychological process underlying illusory lag is formulated as spatiotemporal bias and uncertainty and their estimate as a spatiotemporal convolution kernel that best explains the spatiotemporal psychometric function. Two empirical procedures of kernel estimation are described. One procedure is to fit the free parameters of the kernel to experimental data for continuous motion trajectory. The second is to give an analytical solution to the kernel using experimental data for random motion trajectory. The two procedures yield similar kernels, with negligible spatial bias and uncertainty and substantial temporal bias and uncertainty. In addition, it is demonstrated that an experimental manipulation of temporal predictability of the flash can change the temporal bias in the estimated kernel. The results of this novel analysis reveal that the flash-lag effect is viewed as a spatiotemporal correlation structure, which is largely characterized by the tendency to compare the position of the flash in the past with the position of the moving item in the present.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the future course of a moving target is invaluable for planning actions. We used trajectory detection in noise to investigate this predictive capability. Using a contrast probe technique, we showed that in noise, contrast increments are more easily seen at the end of the trajectory than at the beginning. Analyses of the contrast data revealed that the improvement at the end of the trajectory was due to a substantial reduction in the number of detectors monitored, as well as to an increase in the gain of detectors responding to the increment. It appears that the first segment of the trajectory acts as an automatic cue that draws attention to subsequent segments of the trajectory, leading to enhanced detectability for predictable motion trajectories.},

	Abstract = {Visual cortex contains a set of field maps in which nearby scene points are represented in the responses of nearby neurons. We tested a recent hypothesis that the visual field map in primary visual cortex (V1) is dynamic, changing in response to stimulus motion direction. The original experimental report replicates, but further experimental and analytical investigations do not support, the interpretation of the results. The V1 map remains invariant when measured using stimuli moving in different directions. The measurements can be explained by small and systematic response amplitude differences that arise when probing with stimuli moving in different directions. },

@article{Schira:2007rt,
	Abstract = {Primate visual cortex contains a set of maps of visual space. These maps are fundamental to early visual processing, yet their form is not fully understood in humans. This is especially true for the central and most important part of the visual field--the fovea. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the mapping geometry of human V1 and V2 down to 0.5{\{}degrees{\}} of eccentricity. By applying automated atlas fitting procedures to parametrize and average retinotopic measurements of eight brains, we provide a reference standard for the two-dimensional geometry of human early visual cortex of unprecedented precision and analyze this high-quality mean dataset with respect to the 2-dimensional cortical magnification morphometry. The analysis indicates that 1) area V1 has meridional isotropy in areal projection: equal areas of visual space are mapped to equal areas of cortex at any given eccentricity. 2) V1 has a systematic pattern of local anisotropies: cortical magnification varies between isopolar and isoeccentricity lines, and 3) the shape of V1 deviates systematically from the complex-log model, the fit of which is particularly poor close to the fovea. We therefore propose that human V1 be fitted by models based on an equal-area principle of its two-dimensional magnification. 4) V2 is elongated by a factor of 2 in eccentricity direction relative to V1 and has significantly more local anisotropy. We propose that V2 has systematic intrinsic curvature, but V1 is intrinsically flat. },

@article{Qiu:2006fj,
	Abstract = { Human primary visual cortex is organized retinotopically, with adjacent locations in cortex representing adjacent locations on the retina. The spatial sampling in cortex is highly nonuniform: the amount of cortex devoted to a unit area of retina decreases with increasing retinal eccentricity. This sampling property can be quantified by the linear cortical magnification factor, which is expressed in terms of millimeters of cortex per degree of visual angle. In this paper, we present a new method using dynamic programming and fMRI retinotopic eccentricity mapping to estimate the linear cortical magnification factor in human primary visual cortex (V1). We localized cortical activity while subjects viewed each of seven stationary contrast- reversing radial checkerboard rings of equal thickness that tiled the visual field from 1.62 to 12.96 degrees of eccentricity. Imaging data from all epochs of each ring were contrasted with data from fixation epochs on a subject-by-subject basis. The resulting t statistic maps were then superimposed on a local coordinate system constructed from the gray/white matter boundary surface of each individual subject's occipital lobe, separately for each ring. Smoothed maps of functional activity on the cortical surface were constructed using orthonormal bases of the Laplace-Beltrami operator that incorporate the geometry of the cortical surface. This allowed us to stably track the ridge of maximum activation due to each ring via dynamic programming optimization over all possible paths on the cortical surface. We estimated the linear cortical magnification factor by calculating geodesic distances between activation ridges on the cortical surface in a population of five normal subjects. The reliability of these estimates was assessed by comparing results based on data from one quadrant to those based on data from the full hemifield along with a split-half reliability analysis.},

@article{DoughertyRobertF2003,
	Abstract = {The position, surface area and visual field representation of human visual areas V1, V2 and V3 were measured using fMRI in 7 subjects (14 hemispheres). Cortical visual field maps of the central 12 deg were measured using rotating wedge and expanding ring stimuli. The boundaries between areas were identified using an automated procedure to fit an atlas of the expected visual field map to the data. All position and surface area measurements were made along the boundary between white matter and gray matter.The representation of the central 2 deg of visual field in areas V1, V2, V3 and hV4 spans about 2100 mm2 and is centered on the lateral-ventral aspect of the occipital lobes at Talairach coordinates -29, -78, -11 and 25, -80, -9. The mean area between the 2-deg and 12-deg eccentricities for the primary visual areas was: V1: 1470 mm2; V2: 1115 mm2; and V3: 819 mm2. The sizes of areas V1, V2 and V3 varied by about a factor of 2.5 across individuals; the sizes of V1 and V2 are significantly correlated within individuals, but there is a very low correlation between V1 and V3.These in vivo measurements of normal human retinotopic visual areas can be used as a reference for comparison to unusual cases involving developmental plasticity, recovery from injury, identifying homology with animal models, or analyzing the computational resources available within the visual pathways.},

	Abstract = {A method of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure retinotopic organization within human cortex is described. The method is based on a visual stimulus that creates a traveling wave of neural activity within retinotopically organized visual areas. We measured the fMRI signal caused by this stimulus in visual cortex and represented the results on images of the flattened cortical sheet. We used the method to locate visual areas and to evaluate the spatial precision of fMRI. Specifically, we: (i) identified the borders between several retinotopically organized visual areas in the posterior occipital lobe; (ii) measured the function relating cortical position to visual field eccentricity within area V1; (iii) localized activity to within 1.1 mm of visual cortex; and (iv) estimated the spatial resolution of the fMRI signal and found that signal amplitude falls to 60% at a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per 9 mm of visual cortex. This spatial resolution is consistent with a linespread whose full width at half maximum spreads across 3.5 mm of visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Much of the visual cortex is organized into visual field maps: nearby neurons have receptive fields at nearby locations in the image. Mammalian species generally have multiple visual field maps with each species having similar, but not identical, maps. The introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to identify visual field maps in human cortex, including several near (1) medial occipital (V1,V2,V3), (2) lateral occipital (LO-1,LO-2, hMT+), (3) ventral occipital (hV4, VO-1, VO-2), (4) dorsal occipital (V3A, V3B), and (5) posterior parietal cortex (IPS-0 to IPS-4). Evidence is accumulating for additional maps, including some in the frontal lobe. Cortical maps are arranged into clusters in which several maps have parallel eccentricity representations, while the angular representations within a cluster alternate in visual field sign. Visual field maps have been linked to functional and perceptual properties of the visual system at various spatial scales, ranging from the level of individual maps to map clusters to dorsal-ventral streams. We survey recent measurements of human visual field maps, describe hypotheses about the function and relationships between maps, and consider methods to improve map measurements and characterize the response properties of neurons comprising these maps.},

@article{Adams:2003fy,
	Abstract = {Shadows cast by retinal blood vessels are represented in striate cortex of the squirrel monkey. Their pattern was exploited to generate a true retinotopic map of V1. For calibration, retinal landmarks were projected onto a tangent screen to measure their visual field location. Next, the retina was warped onto striate cortex, distorting it as necessary to match each retinal vessel to its cortical representation. Maps from four hemispheres of two normal adult squirrel monkeys were created and used to derive expressions for cortical magnification factor (M). A mean map was produced by averaging the individual maps. To address the controversial issue of whether the ratio of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density to M is constant at all eccentricities, we stained a retinal whole mount from one of the two monkeys for Nissl substance. A ganglion cell density map was compiled by sampling the concentration of cells at 171 retinal points. Allowance was made for displaced amacrine cells and for the centripetal displacement of RGCs from central photoreceptors. After these corrections the V1 surface area and RGC density were compared at each eccentricity. The cortical representation of the macula was found to be amplified, even beyond the magnification expected from its high density of RGCs. For example, the central 4 degrees of visual field were allotted 27% of the surface area of V1 but were supplied by only 12% of RGCs. We conclude that, in monkey striate cortex, more tissue is allocated per ganglion cell for the analysis of information emanating from the macula as compared with the peripheral retina.},

	Abstract = {Johnston (1986) proposed that the global geometry of the striate cortical map in primates can be understood with reference to a conic surface in visual space oriented with its base in the plane of the eye and axis along the line of sight. Here, cortical magnification data from the macaque, squirrel and cebus monkeys and distance data from topographic maps of the macaque and owl monkey cortex are used as a further test of this proposal. Though there is a substantial difference in the emphasis placed on foveal vision in the owl monkey and the macaque topographic maps, both can be accommodated by the conic model with a change of parameter. The theory has also been extended in an attempt to model the differential changes in mean cortical receptive field size and inverse magnification with eccentricity found in the macaque. Though cortical receptive fields increase in size with eccentricity when measured on a spherical screen, mean receptive field size should be constant if measured on a tangent planes to a cone with an apical half angle of around 6.4 deg.},

@article{Albright:1987vl,
	Abstract = {The representation of the visual field in the middle temporal area (MT) was examined by recording from single neurons in anesthetized, immobilized macaques. Measurements of receptive field size, variability of receptive field position (scatter) and magnification factor were obtained within the representation of the central 25 degree. Over at least short distances (less than 3 mm), the visual field representation in MT is surprisingly orderly. Receptive field size increases as a linear function of eccentricity and is about ten times larger than in V1 at all eccentricities. Scatter in receptive field position at any point in the visual field representation is equal to about one-third of the receptive field size at that location, the same relationship that has been found in V1. Magnification factor in MT is only about one-fifth that reported in V1 within the central 5 degree but appears to decline somewhat less steeply than in V1 with increasing eccentricity. Because the smaller magnification factor in MT relative to V1 is complemented by larger receptive field size and scatter, the point-image size (the diameter of the region of cortex activated by a single point in the visual field) is roughly comparable in the two areas. On the basis of these results, as well as on our previous finding that 180 degrees of axis of stimulus motion in MT are represented in about the same amount of tissue as 180 degrees of stimulus orientation in V1, we suggest that a stimulus at one point in the visual field activates at least as many functional "modules" in MT as in V1.},

	Abstract = {The ability to report the direction of apparent motion when an array of random dots is displaced fails when the displacement exceeds a limiting value (dmax). We find that dmax increases rapidly with retinal eccentricity, in a manner different from spatial measures such as acuity which are believed to depend on the "magnification factor" of projection to area 17. The minimum displacement giving detectable motion (dmin) shows a shallower increase with eccentricity which is more compatible with the variation of cortical magnification. The dependence of apparent motion on the timing variables (exposure duration, inter-stimulus interval) changes negligibly with eccentricity. Consequently the dynamic range and the upper limit of detectable velocities increases greatly with eccentricity. The increase of dmax with eccentricity means that the perception of apparent motion will show an approximate invariance with display scale, even though dmax has a locally fixed value depending on receptive field structure.},

	Abstract = {The topographic organization of striate cortex in the macaque was studied using physiological recording techniques. Results were displayed on two-dimensional maps of the cortex, which facilitated the quantitative analysis of various features of the visual representation. The representation was found to be asymmetric with more cortex devoted to lower than to upper fields. Over much of striate cortex the representation is anisotropic, in that the magnification factor depends upon the direction along which it is measured. There is considerable individual variability in these features as well as in the overall size of striate cortex. Outside the fovea, the cortical representation shows only modest deviations from a logarithmic conformal mapping, in which the magnification factor is proportional to the inverse of eccentricity in the visual field. Comparison of receptive field size with cortical magnification was used to estimate the "point image size" in the cortex (i.e. the extent of cortex concerned with processing inputs from any given point in the visual field). Our evidence supports a previous report that point-image size varies significantly with eccentricity. This is of interest in relation to anatomical evidence that the dimensions of columnar systems in striate cortex are largely independent of eccentricity.},

@article{Rovamo:1992hb,
	Abstract = {Using computer graphics and a two-alternative forced-choice method we measured threshold contrast as a function of viewing distance, spatial frequency, and eccentricity for gratings with and without added, white two-dimensional spatial noise. Our experiments showed that in spatial noise contrast sensitivity was independent of viewing distance as long as contrast sensitivity was lower with noise than without. With increasing spatial frequency (f) the grating area (A) was reduced in order to keep the relative grating size (Af2) constant. At all spatial frequencies the test gratings thus had the same amount of detail and contour. Noise spectral density was reduced in direct proportion to grating area in order to keep the physical signal-to-noise ratio constant. An increase in spatial frequency was thus accompanied with reductions in grating area and noise spectral density similar to those produced by a corresponding increase in viewing distance. In agreement, contrast detection in spatial noise was found to be independent of spatial frequency as long as contrast sensitivity was lower with noise than without. The effect of increasing eccentricity on visual performance can be compensated for by reducing the viewing distance (M-scaling). Hence, without M-scaling the effect of increasing eccentricity is similar to that of increasing viewing distance. In agreement, we found that contrast sensitivity in spatial noise was independent of eccentricity as long as contrast sensitivity was lower with noise than without.},

@article{Johnston:1983jt,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed some remarkably simple relationships between visual performance and the neuroanatomy of the visual pathways. The visual field is mapped topographically on the surface of the striate cortex in man; the projection is large for the central visual field and is progressively compressed towards the periphery. Visual acuity decreases with distance from the fovea in proportion to the estimated cortical magnification factor, M (the extent of striate cortex in millimetres corresponding to a degree of arc in visual space). If a stimulus is magnified at peripheral locations in proportion to 1/M, it becomes equally resolvable across the visual field. This scaling procedure (M-scaling) maintains equivalence of the cortical projection of stimuli with different visual field loci. We have used M-scaling to investigate motion perception as a visual field variable. We report here that both the lower threshold of motion and adaptation to motion are uniform for M-scaled stimuli, and are related to the velocity of the 'cortical image'.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently the mainstay of neuroimaging in cognitive neuroscience. Advances in scanner technology, image acquisition protocols, experimental design, and analysis methods promise to push forward fMRI from mere cartography to the true study of brain organization. However, fundamental questions concerning the interpretation of fMRI data abound, as the conclusions drawn often ignore the actual limitations of the methodology. Here I give an overview of the current state of fMRI, and draw on neuroimaging and physiological data to present the current understanding of the haemodynamic signals and the constraints they impose on neuroimaging data interpretation.},

	Abstract = {Electrodes are the essential elements of clinical neurophysiology both in recording of neural activity and in functional electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Therefore it is important to understand the potential complications of using electrodes. In this paper, the factors that influence the chance of electrode related injury are discussed from a theoretical standpoint. The mechanical factors, especially pressure related injury, are discussed first, followed by a discussion of injury that is of chemical origin such as contact dermatitis. Next, the ways in which electrical currents flowing from electrodes can cause injury including: Joule heating, electroporation, electroconformational denaturation, and excitatory neurotoxicity are discussed. The differential effects of constant current and constant voltage stimulation on tissue heating are examined, as are the effects of the conductivity and geometric structure of the stimulated tissue. Finally, the effects of electrochemical reactions are discussed both in the context of surface and implanted electrodes.},

	Abstract = {TASERs deliver electrical pulses that can temporarily incapacitate subjects. The goal of this paper is to analyze the distribution of currents in muscle layers and understand the electro-muscular incapacitation safety and efficacy of TASERs. The analyses describe skeletal muscle and motor nerve activation, cell electroporation and current and electric field distributions through skin, fat and muscle layers, under worst-case assumptions for TASER electrode penetration and separation. For the muscle layer, the analysis predicts worst-case current-density and field-strength values of 94 mA/cm(2) and 47 V/cm. Both values are higher than thresholds required for neuromuscular activation but significantly lower than levels needed for permanent cellular electroporation or tissue damage. The results indicate that TASERs are safe and effective in producing temporary subject incapacitation.},

Data from the chick model were verified by repeating some measurements on porcine retina in-vitro. The electrode size varied from 100 microm to 1 mm, pulse duration from 6 micros to 6 ms, and the number of pulses from 1 to 7500. The threshold current density for damage was independent of electrode size for diameters greater than 300 microm, and scaled as 1/r2 for electrodes smaller than 200 microm. Damage threshold decreased with the number of pulses, dropping by a factor of 14 on the CAM and 7 on the retina as the number of pulses increased from 1 to 50, and remained constant for a higher numbers of pulses. The damage threshold current density on large electrodes scaled with pulse duration as approximately 1/t0.5, characteristic of electroporation. The threshold current density for repeated exposure on the retina varied between 0.061 A/cm2 at 6 ms to 1.3 A/cm2 at 6 micros. The highest ratio of the damage threshold to the stimulation threshold in retinal ganglion cells occurred at pulse durations near chronaxie-around 1.3 ms.},

	Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a means of stimulating the brain from outside the skull with little, and occasionally no discomfort for the subject. A single TMS pulse, lasting less than 1 ms, can briefly disrupt the normal activity of a targeted region of the brain for tens of milliseconds, allowing the effects of disruption on specific perceptual and cognitive tasks to be measured behaviorally. Rapid, repeated pulses can disrupt activity for correspondingly longer periods. The reversibility of the effects make it possible to create 'virtual patients' who can be tested in the same way as actual patients with real brain damage in order to explore regional functional specialization. Although several aspects of TMS continue to be evaluated, such as its safety, the extent and localization of the effective region of induced electrical current, the importance of the waveform of the pulse, the configuration and positioning of the coil, its productivity has been firmly established in little more than 10 years of systematic use. Examples of the latter are given from investigations of the nature of visual phosphenes produced by TMS applied to different regions of the visual cortex in normal subjects and subjects with occipital or ocular damage in an attempt to reveal the role of visual cortex in visual awareness.},

DEVELOPMENT: We summarize the physics foundations and neurobiologic principles of action of TMS. We offer an introduction to the core aspects of instrument design and delivery technique of TMS to assure efficacy and safety. We discuss the possibility of real-time merging of TMS with neuroimaging methods (such as functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography) to characterize neural networks in health and disease. We present evidence that repetitive TMS can be used to modulate excitability across a neural network and thus offers therapeutic applications in neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: TMS offers a unique opportunity to characterize and modulate neural networks in normal subjects and patients with diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. TMS can be used with diagnostic as well as therapeutic goals children, adults and elderly with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {Cortical excitability changes induced by tDCS and revealed by TMS, are increasingly being used as an index of neuronal plasticity in the human cortex. The aim of this paper is to summarize the partially adverse effects of 567 tDCS sessions over motor and non-motor cortical areas (occipital, temporal, parietal) from the last 2 years, on work performed in our laboratories. One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5%), migraine patients (8.8%), post-stroke patients (5.9%) and tinnitus patients (9.8%). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6%), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3% of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4% of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8%), nausea (2.9%) and insomnia (0.98%) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p=0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p=0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p=0.03) after the stimulation. Our results suggest that tDCS applied to motor and non-motor areas according to the present tDCS safety guidelines, is associated with relatively minor adverse effects in healthy humans and patients with varying neurological disorders.},

@article{Rossini:2007dn,
	Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a 20-year-old technique originally introduced to noninvasively investigate nervous propagation along the corticospinal tract, spinal roots, and peripheral nerves in humans. TMS is extensively used in clinical neurophysiology, including rehabilitation and intraoperative monitoring. Single-pulse TMS and other more recent versions (paired-pulse TMS, repetitive TMS, integration with structural and functional MRI, and neuronavigation) allow motor output to be mapped precisely to a given body district. Moreover, TMS can be used to evaluate excitatory/inhibitory intracortical circuits and to provide information on brain physiology and pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric diseases as well as on the mechanisms of brain plasticity and of neuroactive drugs. TMS applied over nonmotor areas made it possible to extend research applications (often complementary with other functional neuroimaging techniques) in several fields of psychophysiology, causally testing brain-behavior relationships. Being able to induce relatively long-lasting excitability changes, repetitive TMS has made the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases linked with brain excitability dysfunctions possible. These uses, however, warrant further large-scale studies. In emerging fields of research, TMS-EEG co-registration is considered a promising approach to evaluate corticocortical connectivity and brain reactivity with high temporal resolution. However, safety and ethical limitations of TMS technique need a high level of vigilance.},

@article{Lytle:2000rw,
	Abstract = {Three representative electrostimulators were evaluated to determine whether they meet the manufacturers' labeled nominal output parameters and how the measured parameters compare with a safety standard written for implanted peripheral nerve stimulators. The pulsed outputs (pulse width, frequency, and voltage) of three devices were measured with an oscilloscope across a 500-ohm resistance, meant to simulate subdermal tissue stimulated during electroacupuncture. For each device, at least two measured parameters were not within 25% of the manufacturer's claimed values. The measured values were compared with the American National Standard ANSI/AAMI NS15 safety standard for implantable peripheral nerve stimulators. Although for two stimulators the pulse voltage at maximum intensity was above that specified by the standard, short-term clinical use may still be safe because the standard was written for long-term stimulation. Similarly, the net unbalanced DC current, which could lead to tissue damage, electrolysis, and electrolytic degradation of the acupuncture needle, was within the limits of the standard at 30 pulses per second, but not at higher frequencies. The primary conclusions are (1) that the outputs of electrostimulators must be calibrated and (2) that practitioners must be adequately trained to use these electrostimulators safely.},

@article{Terao:2002rc,
	Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now established as an important noninvasive measure for neurophysiologic investigation of the central and peripheral nervous systems in humans. Magnetic stimulation can be used for stimulating peripheral nerves with a similar mechanism of activation as for electrical stimulation. When TMS is applied to the cerebral cortex, however, some features emerge that distinguish it from transcranial electrical stimulation. One of the most important features is designated the D and I wave hypothesis, which is now widely accepted as a mechanism of TMS of the motor cortex. Transcranial electrical stimulation excites the pyramidal tract axons directly, either at the initial segment of the neuron or at proximal internodes in the subcortical white matter, giving rise to D (direct) waves, whereas TMS excites the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically, giving rise to I (indirect) waves. There are still other phenomena with mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. First, not only excitatory effects but also inhibitory effects can be elicited by TMS of the cerebral cortex (e.g., the silent period and intracortical inhibition). The inhibitory effect may also be used to investigate cerebral functions other than the motor cortex, such as the visual, sensory cortices, and the frontal eye field, from which no overt response like the motor evoked potential can be elicited. Second, there is an abundance of intraregional functional connectivities among different cortical areas that can also be revealed by TMS, or TMS in combination with neuroimaging techniques. Last, repetitive transcranial stimulation exerts a lasting effect on brain function even after the stimulation has ceased. With further investigation of the neural mechanisms of TMS, these techniques will open up new possibilities for investigating the physiologic function of the brain as well as opportunities for clinical application.},

	Abstract = {Motion transparency occurs when multiple object velocities are present within a local region of retinotopic space. Transparent signals can carry information useful in the segmentation of moving objects and in the extraction of three-dimensional structure from relative motion cues. However, the physiological substrate underlying the detection of motion transparency is poorly understood. Direction tuned neurons in area MT are suppressed by transparent stimuli, suggesting that other motion sensitive areas may be needed to represent this signal robustly. Recent neuroimaging evidence implicated two such areas in the macaque superior temporal sulcus. We studied one of these, FST, with electrophysiological methods and found that a large fraction of the neurons responded well to two opposite directions of motion and to transparent stimuli containing those same directions. A linear combination of MT-like responses qualitatively reproduces this behavior and predicts that FST neurons can be tuned for transparent motion containing specific direction and depth components. We suggest that FST plays a role in motion segmentation based on transparent signals.},

This process requires a prediction of the target's motion, since the initial direction of the hand movement anticipates target motion. This experiment was designed to define the visual motion parameters that are incorporated in this prediction of target motion. Upon seeing a go signal (a change in target color), human subjects slid the right index finger along a touch-sensitive computer monitor to intercept a target moving along an unseen circular or oval path. The analysis focused on the initial direction of the interception movement, which was found to be influenced by the time required to intercept the target and the target's distance from the finger's starting location. Initial direction also depended on the curvature of the target's trajectory in a manner that suggested that this parameter was underestimated during the process of extrapolation. The pattern of smooth pursuit eye movements suggests that the extrapolation of visual target motion was based on local motion cues around the time of the onset of hand movement, rather than on a cognitive synthesis of the target's pattern of motion.},

@article{Van-Wetter:2008xx,
	Abstract = {Localization of a target flash is inaccurate when presented around the onset of a saccadic eye movement, and errors vary systematically with the target-saccade onset delay. We have recently shown that under head-fixed conditions these perisaccadic errors do not follow the quantitative predictions of current visuomotor updating models that explain these mislocalizations in terms of spatial updating. These models all assume sluggish eye-movement feedback, and predict that errors vary systematically with the amplitude and kinematics of the intervening saccade. Instead, we reported that errors depend only weakly on saccade amplitude. An alternative explanation is that around the saccade the perceived target location undergoes a uniform transient shift in the saccade direction, but that the oculomotor feedback is, on average, accurate. This 'visual shift' hypothesis predicts that errors will also remain insensitive to kinematic variability of much larger head-free gaze shifts. Here we test this prediction by presenting a brief visual probe near the onset of gaze saccades between 40 and 70 deg amplitude. According to models with inaccurate gaze-motor feedback, expected perisaccadic errors should be as large as 30 deg, and depend heavily on gaze-shift kinematics. In contrast, we found that the peak errors were similar to those of much smaller saccadic eye movements, i.e. about 10 deg, and that neither gaze-shift amplitude, nor kinematics plays a systematic role. Our data further corroborate the visual origin of perisaccadic mislocalization, and strengthen the idea that efferent feedback in the gaze control system is fast and accurate.},

	Abstract = {Rapid reaching to a target is generally accurate but also contains random and systematic error. Random errors result from noise in visual measurement, motor planning, and reach execution. Systematic error results from systematic changes in the mapping between the visual estimate of target location and the motor command necessary to reach the target (e.g., new spectacles, muscular fatigue). Humans maintain accurate reaching by recalibrating the visuomotor system, but no widely accepted computational model of the process exists. Given certain boundary conditions, a statistically optimal solution is a Kalman filter. We compared human to Kalman filter behavior to determine how humans take into account the statistical properties of errors and the reliability with which those errors can be measured. For most conditions, human and Kalman filter behavior was similar: Increasing measurement uncertainty caused similar decreases in recalibration rate; directionally asymmetric uncertainty caused different rates in different directions; more variation in systematic error increased recalibration rate. However, behavior differed in one respect: Inserting random error by perturbing feedback position causes slower adaptation in Kalman filters but had no effect in humans. This difference may be due to how biological systems remain responsive to changes in environmental statistics. We discuss the implications of this work.},

@article{Hemptinne:2008sf,
	Abstract = {Expectation of upcoming events is an essential cognitive function on which anticipatory actions are based. The neuronal basis of this prospective representation is poorly understood. We trained rhesus monkeys in a smooth-pursuit task in which the direction of upcoming target motion was indicated using a color cue. Under these conditions, directional expectation frequently evoked anticipatory smooth movements. We found that the activity of a population of neurons in the supplementary eye fields encoded the expected future direction of the target. Neuronal activity increased after presentation of the cue, indicating future target motion in the preferred direction. Neuronal activity either remained unaltered or was reduced if the antipreferred direction was cued. In addition, approximately 30% of these neurons were more active during trials with anticipatory pursuit in the preferred direction than during trials when monkeys did not anticipate target motion onset. This subset of recorded neurons encoded the direction of the subsequent anticipatory pursuit. We hypothesize that the neural representation of directional expectation could be conceptualized as a competitive interaction between pools of neurons representing likely future events, with the winner of this competition determining the direction of the subsequent anticipatory movement. Similar mechanisms could drive prediction before movement initiation in other motor domains.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies and models of perceptual decision making have largely focused on binary choices. However, we often have to choose from multiple alternatives. To study the neural mechanisms underlying multialternative decision making, we have asked human subjects to make perceptual decisions between multiple possible directions of visual motion. Using a multicomponent version of the random-dot stimulus, we were able to control experimentally how much sensory evidence we wanted to provide for each of the possible alternatives. We demonstrate that this task provides a rich quantitative dataset for multialternative decision making, spanning a wide range of accuracy levels and mean response times. We further present a computational model that can explain the structure of our behavioral dataset. It is based on the idea of a race between multiple integrators to a decision threshold. Each of these integrators accumulates net sensory evidence for a particular choice, provided by linear combinations of the activities of decision-relevant pools of sensory neurons.},

	Abstract = {Saccades may not always wait for the completion of the perceptual analysis. By taking advantage of a motion-induced illusion of position and of the spontaneous scatter of saccade latency, we showed that in normal observers, regular saccades (latency, approximately 200 ms) were accurately directed to the target, whereas at higher latencies, saccades were increasingly biased by visual motion until they reflected the perceptual illusion. We reconstructed the time course of saccadic direction coding and identified an early phase in which saccades are mostly predictive (latencies less than approximately 100 ms), followed by a phase in which saccades are guided by the target position signal (latencies approximately 100-250 ms), and a later phase associated with the buildup of mislocalization (approximately 250-450 ms). This transient dissociation between action and perception indicates that seeing and looking are based on asynchronous processes, possibly because of independent thresholds for saccades and perceptual localization. The metrics of a saccade would then reflect the evolution of cortical visual signals from a predictive state to a perceptual state, passing through an intermediate visuomotor state. If saccades occur during the visuomotor state, they escape the tricks of perception.},

	Abstract = {Perception of depth is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, particularly for observers moving through their environment. The brain makes use of multiple visual cues to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a scene. One potent cue, motion parallax, frequently arises during translation of the observer because the images of objects at different distances move across the retina with different velocities. Human psychophysical studies have demonstrated that motion parallax can be a powerful depth cue, and motion parallax seems to be heavily exploited by animal species that lack highly developed binocular vision. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this capacity. Here we show, by using a virtual-reality system to translate macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) while they viewed motion parallax displays that simulated objects at different depths, that many neurons in the middle temporal area (area MT) signal the sign of depth (near versus far) from motion parallax in the absence of other depth cues. To achieve this, neurons must combine visual motion with extra-retinal (non-visual) signals related to the animal's movement. Our findings suggest a new neural substrate for depth perception and demonstrate a robust interaction of visual and non-visual cues in area MT. Combined with previous studies that implicate area MT in depth perception based on binocular disparities, our results suggest that area MT contains a more general representation of three-dimensional space that makes use of multiple cues.},

	Abstract = {1. Electrophysiological recordings were made in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of five macaque monkeys. Binocularity and selectivity for disparity were examined using a computer-driven stimulator to activate each eye independently. Results were obtained from 91 single units in MT. 2. Most units in MT receive approximately balanced inputs from the two eyes, and very few could be driven through only one eye. 3. In one type of test for disparity selectivity, units were examined with stimuli that had different but fixed horizontal disparities, thereby simulating frontoparallel movements at different distances from the animal. About two-thirds of ;the units tested for fixed disparity selectivity (52/76) showed pronounced sensitivity to horizontal disparity. Most of these units could be grouped into the same four classes of disparity-tuned units that have previously been described in V1 and V2 of the macaque: near, far, tuned excitatory, and tuned inhibitory. 4. Twenty units were tested for sensitivity to vertical stimulus disparity, which does not normally contribute to stereopsis. Most were as sensitive to vertical disparities as to horizontal. 5. Units were also tested for selectivity for stimuli that moved with changing disparity, simulating trajectories with components of motion toward or away from the animal (motion in depth). No units were found to be truly selective for motion in depth. Units tuned for fixed disparity could appear to prefer motion in depth if tested only with trajectories whose common center point was far from the unit's optimal fixed disparity. However, we do not consider this to represent genuine selectivity for motion in depth, since 1) the responses ara adequately and more easily explained in terms of selectivity for fixed disparity and 2) the best overall response of these units is to frontoparallel motion at the optimal fixed disparity. This observation bears importantly on the interpretation of motion in depth selectivity in previous investigations. 6. The presence of a substantial degree of selectivity for fixed disparity in MT, together with previously demonstrated selectivities for direction and speed, indicates that MT is well suited for the analysis of motion in three-dimensional space.},

	Abstract = {1. We have tested the hypothesis that simple cells in the cat's visual cortex perform a linear spatiotemporal filtering of the visual image. To conduct this study we note that a visual neuron behaves linearly if the responses to small, brief flashes of light are mathematically related, via the Fourier transform, to the responses elicited by sinusoidal grating stimuli. 2. We have evaluated the linearity of temporal and spatial summation for 118 simple cells recorded from the striate cortex (area 17) of adult cats and kittens at ages 4 and 8 wk postnatal. These neurons represent a subset of the population of cells for which we have described the postnatal development of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure in the preceding paper. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles are constructed, with the use of a reverse correlation technique, from the responses to random sequences of small bar stimuli that are brighter or darker than the background. Fourier analysis of spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles yields linear predictions of the cells' spatial and temporal frequency tuning. These predicted responses are compared with spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves measured by the use of drifting, sinusoidal-luminance grating stimuli. 3. For most simple cells, there is good agreement between spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves predicted from the receptive-field profile and those measured by the use of sinusoidal gratings. These results suggest that both spatial and temporal summation within simple cells are approximately linear. There is a tendency for predicted tuning curves to be slightly broader than measured tuning curves, a finding that is consistent with the effects of a threshold nonlinearity at the output of these neurons. In some cases, however, predicted tuning curves deviate from measured responses only at low spatial and temporal frequencies. This cannot be explained by a simple threshold nonlinearity. 4. If linearity is assumed, it should be possible to predict the direction selectivity of simple cells from the structure of their spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles. For virtually all cells, linear predictions correctly determine the preferred direction of motion of a visual stimulus. However, the strength of the directional bias is typically underestimated by a factor of about two on the basis of linear predictions. Consideration of the expansive exponential nonlinearity revealed in the contrast-response function permits a reconciliation of the discrepancy between measured and predicted direction selectivity indexes. 5. Overall, these findings show that spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles obtained with the use of reverse correlation may be used to predict a variety of response properties for simple cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {1. Most studies of cortical neurons have focused on the spatial structure of receptive fields. For a more complete functional description of these neurons, it is necessary to consider receptive-field structure in the joint domain of space and time. We have studied the spatiotemporal receptive-field structure of 233 simple cells recorded from the striate cortex of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. The dual goal of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative description of spatiotemporal receptive-field structure and to compare the developmental time courses of spatial and temporal response properties. 2. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles have been measured with the use of a reverse correlation method, in which we compute the cross-correlation between a neuron's response and a random sequence of small, briefly presented bright and dark stimuli. The receptive-field profiles of some simple cells are space-time separable, meaning that spatial and temporal response characteristics can be dissociated. Other cells have receptive-field profiles that are space-time inseparable. In these cases, a particular spatial location cannot be designated, unambiguously, as belonging to either an on or off subregion. However, separate on and off subregions may be clearly distinguished in the joint space-time domain. These subregions are generally tilted along an oblique axis. 3. Our observations show that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive-field structure mature with clearly different time courses. By 4 wk postnatal, the spatial symmetry and periodicity of simple-cell receptive fields have reached maturity. The spatial extent (or size) of these receptive fields is adult-like by 8 wk postnatal. In contrast, the response latency and time duration of spatiotemporal receptive fields do not mature until well beyond 8 wk postnatal. 4. By applying Fourier analysis to spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles, we have examined the postnatal development of spatial and temporal selectivity in the frequency domain. By 8 wk postnatal, spatial frequency tuning has clearly reached maturity. On the contrary, temporal frequency selectivity remains markedly immature at 8 wk. We have also examined the joint distribution of optimal spatial and temporal frequencies. From 4 wk postnatal until 8 wk postnatal, the range of optimal spatial frequencies increases substantially, whereas the range of optimal temporal frequencies remains largely unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal until adulthood, there is a large increase in optimal temporal frequencies for cells tuned to low spatial frequencies. For cells tuned to high spatial frequencies, the distribution of optimal temporal frequencies does not change much beyond 8 wk postnatal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly classified as simple or complex based upon their sensitivity to the sign of stimulus contrast. The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

	Abstract = {We provide a conceptual overview of two recently developed methodologies for quantitative characterization of sensory neural response properties from extracellular spiking data. Both rely on the use of stochastic stimuli, and both assume a response model with an initial linear stage that serves to reduce the dimensionality of the stimulus space. They differ primarily in their description of spike generation: One family of methods assumes an inhomogeneous Poisson model for spike generation, and the other assumes a generalized form of integrate-and-fire model. We show simulated examples to illustrate procedures for estimation of model parameters from data and discuss the constraints on stimulus design and convergence as a function of the amount of data collected.	},

described with due emphasis on the related problems of parameter estimation and

many, including simplicity, high efficiency, robustness, small-sample

	Abstract = {When viewing a stationary object, we unconsciously make small, involuntary eye movements or 'microsaccades'. If displacements of the retinal image are prevented, the image quickly fades from perception. To understand how microsaccades sustain perception, we studied their relationship to the firing of cells in primary visual cortex (V1). We tracked eye movements and recorded from V1 cells as macaque monkeys fixated. When an optimally oriented line was centered over a cell's receptive field, activity increased after microsaccades. Moreover, microsaccades were better correlated with bursts of spikes than with either single spikes or instantaneous firing rate. These findings may help explain maintenance of perception during normal visual fixation.},

	Abstract = {The usual interpretation of the quantum theory is self-consistent, but it involves an assumption that cannot be tested experimentally, viz., that the most complete possible specification of an individual system is in terms of a wave function that determines only probable results of actual measurement processes. The only way of investigating the truth of this assumption is by trying to find some other interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of at present "hidden" variables, which in principle determine the precise behavior of an individual system, but which are in practice averaged over in measurements of the types that can now be carried out. In this paper and in a subsequent paper, an interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of just such "hidden" variables is suggested. It is shown that as long as the mathematical theory retains its present general form, this suggested interpretation leads to precisely the same results for all physical processes as does the usual interpretation. Nevertheless, the suggested interpretation provides a broader conceptual framework than the usual interpretation, because it makes possible a precise and continuous description of all processes, even at the quantum level. This broader conceptual framework allows more general mathematical formulations of the theory than those allowed by the usual interpretation. Now, the usual mathematical formulation seems to lead to insoluble difficulties when it is extrapolated into the domain of distances of the order of 10-13 cm or less. It is therefore entirely possible that the interpretation suggested here may be needed for the resolution of these difficulties. In any case, the mere possibility of such an interpretation proves that it is not necessary for us to give up a precise, rational, and objective description of individual systems at a quantum level of accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Several recent theoretical models for human spatial vision posit that cortical receptive fields act to minimize simultaneously the product of the standard deviation of the sensitivities to position (delta chi) and to spatial frequency (delta omega) in accord with the uncertainty principle from Fourier analysis. The receptive-field functions resulting from this approach--one-dimensional or two-dimensional Gabor elementary functions--have been shown by others to fit measured receptive fields adequately in some species. However, only complex-valued Gabor functions minimize this product, and these cannot be fitted to single-cell receptive fields. We point out that the derivations of others have an implied metric or measure of positional and spatial-frequency uncertainties and that there is an infinitely large class of such metrics, many of which yield other receptive-field functions that are quite plausible biologically. We review neurophysiological measurements of others and analyze psychophysical masking data and find that in many cases receptive-field functions other than Gabor functions fit better. We conclude that there are insufficient theoretical demonstrations and experimental data to favor Gabor functions over any of a number of other plausible receptive-field functions.},

	Abstract = {Information in the nervous system may be carried by both the rate and timing of neuronal spikes. Recent findings of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have fueled the interest in the potential roles of spike timing in processing and storage of information in neural circuits. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems has been shown to depend on the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking. Spike timing-dependent modification of neuronal excitability and dendritic integration was also observed. Such STDP at the synaptic and cellular level is likely to play important roles in activity-induced functional changes in neuronal receptive fields and human perception.},

	Abstract = {When a vernier target is flanked by optimally positioned lines, foveal vernier discrimination is strongly degraded (Westheimer and Hauske, 1975). We confirmed this observation (Experiment I) and have mapped out a 2 dimensional "perceptive field" for crowding in the fovea using a 2 dot target (Experiment II). Crowding was also measured in peripheral vision, using either small flanking dots as masks (Experiment III), or using repetitive vernier gratings (Experiment IV). The results showed that when scaled in proportion to recent estimates of the cortical magnification factor, vernier acuity is as good in the periphery as it is centrally. Both centrally and peripherally, there appears to be a psychophysical processing module which we term a "perceptive hypercolumn". At all eccentricities vernier thresholds were found to be approximately 1/40 of the size of a perceptive hypercolumn and were elevated if interfering contours are present in the same (or adjacent) hypercolumns.},

	Abstract = {When a near-threshold stimulus is presented, a sensory percept may or may not be produced. The unpredictable outcome of such perceptual judgment is believed to be determined by the activity of neurons in early sensory cortex. We analyzed the responses of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex, recorded while monkeys judged the presence or absence of threshold stimuli. We found that these responses did not covary with the monkeys' perceptual reports. In contrast, the activity of frontal lobe neurons did covary with trial-by-trial judgments. Further control and microstimulation experiments indicated that frontal lobe neurons are closely related to the monkeys' subjective experiences during sensory detection.},

@article{CROPPER:1994tg,
	Abstract = {It was reported by Mullen and Boulton [Vision Res. 32, 483 (1992)] that there is a lack of smooth-motion perception for chromatic stimuli, and we were interested in quantifying this observation to try to see how it relates to the underlying processing of moving chromatic stimuli. We suggest that, if a stimulus looks as though it is not moving smoothly, a greater degree of quantization will be necessary before observers are able to discriminate between fine and coarse temporal sampling of the moving pattern. We used a two-alternative forced-choice discrimination paradigm to measure observers' ability to discriminate finely sampled (smooth) from coarsely sampled (jerky) motion in luminance (achromatic) and chromatic (red-green) gratings. Stimuli were presented for 0.5 s, moved at 2 or 4 Hz, and had a spatial frequency of 1, 5, or 10 cycles/deg. At low contrasts (0.5 log unit above detection threshold), sampled motion was more discriminable in luminance than in chromatic gratings. As contrast increased, performance improved in both chromatic and luminance gratings. As spatial frequency increased, performance improved for chromatic but fell for luminance gratings. Analysis of the data suggests that the ability to discriminate fine from coarsely sampled motion in both luminance and chromatic gratings can be predicted from the temporal Fourier spectra in terms of the ''window of visibility'' [J. Opt. Sec. Am A 3, 300 (1986)]. We conclude that the chromatic window of visibility is smaller than the luminance window at given spatial and temporal frequencies and gives a measure of the temporal resolution of the chromatic motion system. However, our results imply that the window of visibility cannot explain the percept of smooth motion. Under conditions in which there are no visible artifacts in the chromatic stimulus, observers seem still to perceive the motion as jerky, and we consider other possible explanations for this phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {We studied the relationship between the decline in sensitivity that occurs with eccentricity for stimuli of different spatial scale defined by either luminance (LM) or contrast (CM) modulation. We show that the detectability of CM stimuli declines with eccentricity in a spatial frequency-dependent manner, and that the rate of sensitivity decline for CM stimuli is roughly that expected from their 1st order carriers, except, possibly, at finer scales. Using an equivalent noise paradigm, we investigated the possible reasons for why the foveal sensitivity for detecting LM and CM stimuli differs as well as the reason why the detectability of 1st order stimuli declines with eccentricity. We show the former can be modeled by an increase in internal noise whereas the latter involves both an increase in internal noise and a loss of efficiency. To encompass both the threshold and suprathreshold transfer properties of peripheral vision, we propose a model in terms of the contrast gain of the underlying mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Contrast energy thresholds were measured for discriminating the direction of a drifting sinusoidal grating multiplied by an independently drifting space-time Gaussian (a generalized Gabor). We argue that the stimulus with the lowest contrast energy threshold identifies the receptive field of the most efficient linear motion filter. This optimal motion stimulus is found to be at 3 c/deg and 5 Hz, with a width and height of 0.44 deg and a duration of 0.133 sec, corresponding to spatial and temporal bandwidths of 1.1 and 2.5 octaves, respectively. The spectral receptive field is aligned more nearly to the Cartesian axes than to the velocity contour.},

	Abstract = {Watson and Turano (Vision Research 1995;35:325-336) described experimental research aimed at determining the motion stimulus that the visual system detects best. They reported conflicting results in the determination of the optimal spatial size and they interpreted them as an effect of probability summation. They also reported disagreement with earlier results of Watson et al. (Nature 1983;302:419-422). This study shows (i) that probability summation is not responsible for those results and (ii) that they can be explained as a consequence of the method that was used to search for the optimal stimulus.},

@article{Groh:1997oa,
	Abstract = {To generate behavioral responses based on sensory input, motor areas of the brain must interpret, or "read out," signals from sensory maps. Our experiments tested several algorithms for how the motor systems for smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements might extract a usable signal of target velocity from the distributed representation of velocity in the middle temporal visual area (MT or V5). Using microstimulation, we attempted to manipulate the velocity information within MT while monkeys tracked a moving visual stimulus. We examined the effects of the microstimulation on smooth pursuit and on the compensation for target velocity shown by saccadic eye movements. Microstimulation could alter both the speed and direction of the motion estimates of both types of eye movements and could also cause monkeys to generate pursuit even when the visual target was actually stationary. The pattern of alterations suggests that microstimulation can introduce an additional velocity signal into MT and that the pursuit and saccadic systems usually compute a vector average of the visually evoked and microstimulation-induced velocity signals (pursuit, 55 of 122 experiments; saccades, 70 of 122). Microstimulation effects in a few experiments were consistent with vector summation of these two signals (pursuit, 6 of 122; saccades, 2 of 122). In the remainder of the experiments, microstimulation caused either an apparent impairment in motion processing (pursuit, 47 of 122; saccades, 41 of 122) or had no effect (pursuit, 14 of 122; saccades, 9 of 122). Within individual experiments, the effects on pursuit and saccades were usually similar, but the occasional striking exception suggests that the two eye movement systems may perform motion computations somewhat independently.},

	Abstract = {1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in MT. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in MT. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in MT showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in MT of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in MT of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized.},

	Abstract = {With the scleral search coil technique, we recorded ocular following responses elicited by either grating or plaid pattern motions. Grating motion elicited tracking responses at short latencies ( approximately 85 msec). Type I plaid motion made by summing two orthogonal moving gratings elicited ocular following with identical short latencies. Trial-by-trial vector decomposition showed that plaid-driven responses were best predicted by a vector average of the component-driven responses. Similar results were found with micropatterns made of 16 Gabor patches with drifting carriers of two different orientations. "Unikinetic" plaids were constructed by summing a moving and stationary grating, with a 45 degrees orientation difference, so that component and pattern motion directions were separated by 45 degrees. Eye movements exhibited two components. Ocular following was first initiated in the grating motion direction, at ultra-short latency. A second component was initiated approximately 20 msec later, curving the responses toward the pattern motion direction. The later component was specifically, and independently, affected by both relative spatial frequency and contrast between component gratings. The early response components showed a much steeper contrast response function than the late component. These results suggest that initial ocular following is underpinned by parallel processing of component- and pattern-related velocities followed by an integrative stage that computes the two-dimensional surface motion.},

	Abstract = {The activity of neurons in extrastriate middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas were studied during the initiation of pursuit eye movements in macaque monkeys. The intersecting motion of two stimuli was used to test hypotheses about how these direction- and speed-sensitive neurons contribute to the generation of pursuit. The amplitude and direction of the initial saccade to the target and the initial speed and direction of pursuit were best predicted by a vector-average model of the underlying neuronal activity with relatively short time and spatial separation before a visual pursuit target and a distracter stimulus crossed in the visual field. The resulting eye movements were best described by a winner-take-all model when the time and spatial separation between the two stimuli was increased before the stimuli crossed. Neurons in MT and MST also shifted their activity from that best described by a vector average to a winner-take-all model under the same stimulus conditions. The changes in activity of neurons in both areas were generally similar to each other during these changes in pursuit initiation. Thus a slight alteration in the target motion produced a concurrent shift in both the neuronal processing and the movement execution. We propose that the differences in the oculomotor behavior can be accounted for by shifts in the overlap of active neuronal populations within MT and MST.},

@article{Ferrera:1995pm,
	Abstract = {Two rhesus monkeys were trained to track a small moving target in the presence of a moving distractor. The target and distractor were distinguished by their color. Smooth pursuit eye movements were quantified in terms of the latency of the eye movement and the open-loop eye acceleration profile. Smooth pursuit latencies for single targets were on the order of 100 msec. When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the same direction as the target, pursuit latencies decreased to roughly 85 msec. When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the opposite direction, pursuit latencies increased to roughly 150 msec. The motion of the distractor had no significant effect on the eye acceleration profile. Experiments were performed to dissociate visual search for the target from pursuit initiation by providing a spatial cue rather than the color cue. These experiments showed that visual search necessarily preceded pursuit initiation only when the distractor moved in the opposite direction relative to the target. In this case, visual search contributed about 25 msec to the overall latency of pursuit. Control experiments showed that the monkey need not attend to the distractor in order for it to influence the latency of pursuit. A network model was developed in which units that represent the motions of the target and distractor compete against one another. Attention serves to bias the outcome of this competition toward the direction of the selected target. The performance of this network exhibits a striking parallel to the effect of the distractor on smooth pursuit latency.},

	Abstract = {We have used the initiation of pursuit eye movements as a tool to reveal properties of motion processing in the neural pathways that provide inputs to the human pursuit system. Horizontal and vertical eye position were recorded with a magnetic search coil in six normal adults. Stimuli were provided by individual trials of ramp target motion. Analysis was restricted to the first 100 ms of eye movement, which precedes the onset of corrective feedback. By recording the transient response to target motion at speeds the pursuit motor system can achieve, we investigated the visual properties of images that initiate pursuit. We have found effects of varying the retinal location, the direction, the velocity, the intensity, and the size of the stimulus. Eye acceleration in the first 100 ms of pursuit depended on both the direction of target motion and the initial position of the moving target. For horizontal target motion, eye acceleration was highest if the stimulus was close to the center of the visual field and moved toward the vertical meridian. For vertical target motion, eye acceleration was highest when the stimulus moved upward or downward within the lower visual field. The shape of the relationship between eye acceleration and initial target position was similar for target velocities ranging from 1.0 to 45 degrees/s. The initiation of pursuit showed two components that had different visual properties and were expressed early and late in the first 100 ms of pursuit. In the first 20 ms, instantaneous eye acceleration was in the direction of target motion but did not depend on other visual properties of the stimulus. At later times (e.g., 80-100 ms after pursuit initiation), instantaneous eye acceleration was strongly dependent on each property we tested. Targets that started close to and moved toward the position of fixation evoked the highest eye accelerations. For high-intensity targets, eye acceleration increased steadily as target velocity increased. For low-intensity targets, eye acceleration was selective for target velocities of 30-45 degrees/s. The properties of pursuit initiation in humans, including the differences between the early and late components, are remarkably similar to those reported by Lisberger and Westbrook (12) in monkeys. Our data provide evidence that the cell populations responsible for motion processing are similar in humans and monkeys and imply that the functional organization of the visual cortex is similar in the two species.},

@article{Carl:1987js,
	Abstract = {We studied pursuit eye movements in seven normal human subjects with the scleral search-coil technique. The initial eye movements in response to unpredictable changes in target motion were analyzed to determine the effect of target velocity and position on the latency and acceleration of the response. By restricting our analysis to the presaccadic portion of the response we were able to eliminate any saccadic interactions, and the randomized stimulus presentation minimized anticipatory responses. This approach has allowed us to characterize a part of the smooth-pursuit system that is dependent primarily on retinal image properties. The latency of the smooth-pursuit response was very consistent, with a mean of 100 +/- 5 ms to targets moving 5 degrees/s or faster. The responses were the same whether the velocity step was presented when the target was initially stationary or after tracking was established. The latency did increase for lower velocity targets; this increase was well described by a latency model requiring a minimum target movement of 0.028 degrees, in addition to a fixed processing time of 98 ms. The presaccadic accelerations were fairly low, and increased with target velocity until an acceleration of about 50 degrees/s2 was reached for target velocities of 10 degrees/s. Higher velocities produced only a slight increase in eye acceleration. When the target motion was adjusted so that the retinal image slip occurred at increasing distances from the fovea, the accelerations declined until no presaccadic response was measurable when the image slip started 15 degrees from the fovea. The smooth-pursuit response to a step of target position was a brief acceleration; this response occurred even when an oppositely directed velocity stimulus was present. The latency of the pursuit response to such a step was also approximately 100 ms. This result seems consistent with the idea that sensory pathways act as a low-pass spatiotemporal filter of the retinal input, effectively converting position steps into briefly moving stimuli. There was a large asymmetry in the responses to position steps: the accelerations were much greater when the position step of the target was away from the direction of tracking, compared with steps in the direction of tracking. The asymmetry may be due to the addition of a fixed slowing of the eyes whenever the target image disappears from the foveal region. When saccades were delayed by step-ramp stimuli, eye accelerations increased markedly approximately 200 ms after stimulus onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Wallace:2004xw,
	Abstract = {The brain integrates information from multiple sensory modalities and, through this process, generates a coherent and apparently seamless percept of the external world. Although multisensory integration typically binds information that is derived from the same event, when multisensory cues are somewhat discordant they can result in illusory percepts such as the "ventriloquism effect." These biases in stimulus localization are generally accompanied by the perceptual unification of the two stimuli. In the current study, we sought to further elucidate the relationship between localization biases, perceptual unification and measures of a participant's uncertainty in target localization (i.e., variability). Participants performed an auditory localization task in which they were also asked to report on whether they perceived the auditory and visual stimuli to be perceptually unified. The auditory and visual stimuli were delivered at a variety of spatial (0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees ) and temporal (200, 500, 800 ms) disparities. Localization bias and reports of perceptual unity occurred even with substantial spatial (i.e., 15 degrees ) and temporal (i.e., 800 ms) disparities. Trial-by-trial comparison of these measures revealed a striking correlation: regardless of their disparity, whenever the auditory and visual stimuli were perceived as unified, they were localized at or very near the light. In contrast, when the stimuli were perceived as not unified, auditory localization was often biased away from the visual stimulus. Furthermore, localization variability was significantly less when the stimuli were perceived as unified. Intriguingly, on non-unity trials such variability increased with decreasing disparity. Together, these results suggest strong and potentially mechanistic links between the multiple facets of multisensory integration that contribute to our perceptual Gestalt.},

	Abstract = {We examine whether human observers have explicit access to an estimate of their own uncertainty in extrapolating the motion trajectories of moving objects. Objects moved across a display area at constant speed changing direction at short time intervals. Each new direction was obtained by adding a random perturbation to the previous direction. The perturbation distribution was always symmetric with mean zero (no change in direction) but could differ in variability: objects with low directional variability tended to travel in straight lines while objects with high directional variability moved more erratically. Objects eventually disappeared behind the near edge of an occluder. Observers marked a 'capture region' along the far edge of the occluder that they estimated would contain the object when it re-emerged. We varied both occluder width and directional variability across trials and found that observers correctly compensated for these changes. We present a two-stage model of observer performance in which the visual system first estimates the directional variability of the object and then uses this estimate to set a capture region.},

	Abstract = {A number of studies were conducted to determine how many transparent motion signals observers could simultaneously perceive. It was found that that the limit was two. However, observers required a signal intensity of about 42% in order to perceive a bi-directional transparent stimulus. This signal level was about three times that required to detect a uni-directional motion signal, and higher than was physically possible to achieve in a tri-directional stimulus (in a stimulus in which the different transparent signals are defined only by direction). These results indicate that signal intensity plays an important role in establishing the transparency limit and, as a consequence, implicates the global-motion area (V5/MT) in this process.},

@article{Braddick:1997dk,
	Abstract = {Human subjects can perceive global motion or motions in displays containing diverse local motions, implying representation of velocity at multiple scales. The phenomena of flexible global direction judgments, and especially of motion transparency, also raise the issue of whether the representation of velocity at any one scale is single-valued or multi-valued. A new performance-based measure of transparency confirms that the visual system represents directional information for each component of a transparent display. However, results with the locally paired random-dot display introduced by Qian et al, show that representations of multiple velocities do not coexist at the finest spatial scale of motion analysis. Functionally distinct scales of motion processing may be associated with (i) local motion detectors which show a strong winner-take-all interaction; (ii) spatial integration of local signals to disambiguate velocity; (iii) selection of reliable velocity signals as proposed in the model of Nowlan and Sejnowski; (iv) object-based or surface-based representations that are not necessarily organised in a fixed spatial matrix. These possibilities are discussed in relation to the neurobiological organisation of the visual motion pathway.},

@article{Recanzone:1997fu,
	Abstract = {To test the effects of complex visual motion stimuli on the responses of single neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) of the macaque monkey, we compared the response elicited by one object in motion through the receptive field with the response of two simultaneously presented objects moving in different directions through the receptive field. There was an increased response to a stimulus moving in a direction other than the best direction when it was paired with a stimulus moving in the best direction. This increase was significant for all directions of motion of the non-best stimulus and the magnitude of the difference increased as the difference in the directions of the two stimuli increased. Similarly, there was a decreased response to a stimulus moving in a non-null direction when it was paired with a stimulus moving in the null direction. This decreased response in MT did not reach significance unless the second stimulus added to the null direction moved in the best direction, whereas in MST the decrease was significant when the second stimulus direction differed from the null by 90 degrees or more. Further analysis showed that the two-object responses were better predicted by taking the averaged response of the neuron to the two single-object stimuli than by summation, multiplication, or vector addition of the responses to each of the two single-object stimuli. Neurons in MST showed larger modulations than did neurons in MT with stimuli moving in both the best direction and in the null direction and the average better predicted the two-object response in area MST than in area MT. This indicates that areas MT and MST probably use a similar integrative mechanisms to create their responses to complex moving visual stimuli, but that this mechanism is further refined in MST. These experiments show that neurons in both MT and MST integrate the motion of all directions in their responses to complex moving stimuli. These results with the motion of objects were in sound agreement with those previously reported with the use of random dot patterns for the study of transparent motion in MT and suggest that these neurons use similar computational mechanisms in the processing of object and global motion stimuli.},

In particular, 'sophisticated' probabilistic methods apply to structured relational systems such as graphs and grammars, of immediate relevance to the cognitive sciences. This Special Issue outlines progress in this rapidly developing field, which provides a potentially unifying perspective across a wide range of domains and levels of explanation. Here, we introduce the historical and conceptual foundations of the approach, explore how the approach relates to studies of explicit probabilistic reasoning, and give a brief overview of the field as it stands today.},

Traditional accounts of induction emphasize either the power of statistical learning, or the importance of strong constraints from structured domain knowledge, intuitive theories or schemas. We argue that both components are necessary to explain the nature, use and acquisition of human knowledge, and we introduce a theory-based Bayesian framework for modeling inductive learning and reasoning as statistical inferences over structured knowledge representations.},

@article{Landy:1995la,
	Abstract = {Various visual cues provide information about depth and shape in a scene. When several of these cues are simultaneously available in a single location in the scene, the visual system attempts to combine them. In this paper, we discuss three key issues relevant to the experimental analysis of depth cue combination in human vision: cue promotion, dynamic weighting of cues, and robustness of cue combination. We review recent psychophysical studies of human depth cue combination in light of these issues. We organize the discussion and review as the development of a model of the depth cue combination process termed modified weak fusion (MWF). We relate the MWF framework to Bayesian theories of cue combination. We argue that the MWF model is consistent with previous experimental results and is a parsimonious summary of these results. While the MWF model is motivated by normative considerations, it is primarily intended to guide experimental analysis of depth cue combination in human vision. We describe experimental methods, analogous to perturbation analysis, that permit us to analyze depth cue combination in novel ways. In particular these methods allow us to investigate the key issues we have raised. We summarize recent experimental tests of the MWF framework that use these methods.},

	Abstract = {Although many studies have demonstrated that neuronal responses are modulated by attention, the significance of this modulation for behavior is poorly understood. We recorded from neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas in the visual cortex of two macaque monkeys while they performed a motion detection task under two conditions of spatial attention. The ability of the animals to detect the motion was reduced when they withdrew attention from the stimulus. Withdrawing attention also reduced neuronal responses to the motion in both the MT and VIP areas. To compare the neuronal and behavioral effects of attention, the amount of attentional modulation was expressed in units of stimulus strength. On average, attention modulated neuronal responses in MT less than needed to account for the attentional effect on behavior. The opposite was observed in VIP, where the average effect of attention on neuronal responses was greater than that needed to account for behavior. Similar results were obtained when the effects of attention on neuronal response and behavioral performance were compared using a parametric function of stimulus strength. Across neurons in both areas, attentional modulation of neuronal responses was more variable than, and uncorrelated with, attentional modulation of behavioral performance. These findings suggest that attention can alter the average relationship between neuronal activity in visual cortex and behavioral performance. Where this relationship is preserved may indicate which cortical regions are most closely associated with the behavior in a given task.},

@article{Lu:1995la,
	Abstract = {A powerful paradigm (the pedestal-plus-test display) is combined with several subsidiary paradigms (interocular presentation, stimulus superpositions with varying phases, and attentional manipulations) to determine the functional architecture of visual motion perception: i.e. the nature of the various mechanisms of motion perception and their relations to each other. Three systems are isolated: a first-order system that uses a primitive motion energy computation to extract motion from moving luminance modulations; a second-order system that uses motion energy to extract motion from moving texture-contrast modulations; and a third-order system that tracks features. Pedestal displays exclude feature-tracking and thereby yield pure measures of the first- and second-order systems which are found to be exclusively monocular. Interocular displays exclude the first- and second-order systems and thereby to yield pure measures of feature-tracking. Results: both first- and second-order systems are fast (with temporal frequency cutoff at 12 Hz) and sensitive. Feature tracking operates interocularly almost as well as monocularly. It is slower (cutoff frequency is 3 Hz) and it requires much more stimulus contrast than the first- and second-order systems. Feature tracking is both bottom-up (it computes motion from luminance modulation, texture-contrast modulation, depth modulation, motion modulation, flicker modulation, and from other types of stimuli) and top-down--e.g. attentional instructions can determine the direction of perceived motion.},

@article{Dicke:2008kl,
	Abstract = {We are usually unaware of retinal image motion resulting from our own movement. For instance, during slow-tracking eye movements the world around us remains perceptually stable despite the retinal image slip induced by the eye movement. It is commonly held that this example of perceptual invariance is achieved by subtracting an internal reference signal, reflecting the eye movement, from the retinal motion signal. If the two cancel each other, visual objects, which do not move, will also be perceived as non-moving. If, however, the reference signal is too small or too large, a false eye movement-induced motion of the external world, the Filehne illusion, will be perceived. We have exploited our ability to manipulate the size of the reference signal in an attempt to identify neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys, influenced by the percept of self-induced visual motion or the reference signal rather than the retinal motion signal. We report here that such 'percept-related' neurons can already be found in the primary visual cortex area, although few in numbers. They become more frequent in areas middle temporal and medial superior temporal in the superior temporal sulcus, and comprise almost 50% of all neurons in area visual posterior sylvian (VPS) in the posterior part of the lateral sulcus. In summary, our findings suggest that our ability to perceive a visual world, which is stable despite self-motion, is based on a neuronal network, which culminates in the VPS located in the lateral sulcus below the classical dorsal stream of visual processing.},

	Abstract = {We recorded from single neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the macaque monkey and studied their direction and orientation selectivity. We also recorded from single striate cortex (V1) neurons in order to make direct comparisons with our observations in area MT. All animals were immobilized and anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Direction selectivity of 110 MT neurons was studied with three types of moving stimuli: slits, single spots, and random-dot fields. All of the MT neurons were found to be directionally selective using one or more of these stimuli. MT neurons exhibited a broad range of direction-tuning bandwidths to all stimuli (minimum = 32 degrees, maximum = 186 degrees, mean = 95 degrees). On average, responses were strongly unidirectional and of similar magnitude for all three stimulus types. Orientation selectivity of 89 MT neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. Eighty-three percent were found to be orientation selective. Overall, orientation-tuning bandwidths were significantly narrower (mean = 64 degrees) than direction-tuning bandwidths for moving stimuli. Moreover, responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were generally smaller than those to moving stimuli. Direction selectivity of 55 V1 neurons was studied with moving slits; orientation selectivity of 52 V1 neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. In V1, compared with MT, direction-tuning bandwidths were narrower (mean = 68 degrees). Moreover, V1 responses to moving stimuli were weaker, and bidirectional tuning was more common. The mean orientation-tuning bandwidth in V1 was also significantly narrower than that in MT (mean = 52 degrees), but the responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were of similar magnitude in the two areas. We examined the relationship between optimal direction and optimal orientation for MT neurons and found that 61% had an orientation preference nearly perpendicular to the preferred direction of motion, as is the case for all V1 neurons. However, another 29% of MT neurons had an orientation preference roughly parallel to the preferred direction. These observations, when considered together with recent reports claiming sensitivity of some MT neurons to moving visual patterns (39), suggest specific neural mechanisms underlying pattern-motion sensitivity in area MT. These results support the notion that area MT represents a further specialization over area V1 for stimulus motion processing. Furthermore, the marked similarities between direction and orientation tuning in area MT in macaque and owl monkey support the suggestion that these areas are homologues.},

	Annote = {"The other area of difference is that, unlike the call-by-value calling convention used by C, the OpenGL Shading Language uses CALL BY VALUE-RETURN. Input parameters are copied into the function at call time, and output parameters are copied back to the caller before the function exits. Because the function deals only with copies of the function parameters, there are no issues regarding aliasing of variables within a function. Function parameters are identified as input parameters with the qualifier in, they are identified as output parameters with the qualifier out, and they are identified as both input and output parameters with the qualifier inout; if no qualifier is present, they are identified as input parameters." -- Section 2.4.6

"We can divide imaging operations into two broad categories: those that require access to a single pixel at a time and those that require access to multiple pixels at a time. With the OpenGL Shading Language, you can easily implement in a fragment shader the imaging operations that require access to only a single pixel at a time. And within the fragment shader, you can read the varying variable gl_Color to obtain the color value for fragments that were generated with glBitmap or glDrawPixels. Operations that require access to multiple pixels at a time require that the image first be stored in texture memory. You can then access the image multiple times from within a fragment shader to achieve the desired result."  -- Chapter 19},

@article{McIntyre:2008qw,
	Abstract = {The CNS may use multimodal reference frames to combine proprioceptive, visual, and gravitational information. Indeed, spatial information could be encoded simultaneously with respect to egocentric and allocentric references such as the body axis and gravity, respectively. It has further been proposed that gravity might serve to align reference frames between different sensory modalities. We performed a series of experiments in which human subjects matched the orientation of a visual stimulus to a visual reference (visualvisual), a haptic stimulus to a haptic reference (haptichaptic), or a visual stimulus to a haptic reference (visualhaptic). These tests were performed in a normal upright posture, with the body tilted with respect to gravity, and in the weightless environment of Earth orbit. We found systematic patterns of errors in the matching of stimulus orientations. For an upright posture on Earth, a classic oblique effect appeared in the visualvisual comparison, which was then amplified in the hapticvisual task. Leftward or rightward whole-body tilt on Earth abolished both of these effects, yet each persisted in the absence of gravity. Leftward and rightward tilt also produced asymmetric biases in the visualhaptic but not in the visualvisual or haptichaptic responses. These results illustrate how spatial anisotropy can be molded by sensorimotor transformations in the CNS. Furthermore, the results indicate that gravity plays a significant, but nonessential role in defining the reference frames for these tasks. These results provide insight into how the nervous system processes spatial information between different sensory modalities.

	Abstract = {This introduction to R is derived from an original set of notes describing the S and S-Plus 
environments written by Bill Venables and David M. Smith (Insightful Corporation). We have 
made a number of small changes to reflect differences between the R and S programs, and 
expanded some of the material. 
We would like to extend warm thanks to Bill Venables (and David Smith) for granting 
permission to distribute this modified version of the notes in this way, and for being a supporter 
of R from way back. 
Comments and corrections are always welcome. Please address email correspondence to 
R-core@R-project.org. 
Suggestions to the reader 
Most R novices will start with the introductory session in Appendix A. This should give some 
familiarity with the style of R sessions and more importantly some instant feedback on what 
actually happens. 
Many users will come to R mainly for its graphical facilities. In this case, Chapter 12 
[Graphics], page 62 on the graphics facilities can be read at almost any time and need not wait 
until all the preceding sections have been digested.},

	Abstract = {Apparent motion is an illusory perception of movement that can be induced by alternating presentations of static objects. Already in Wertheimer's early investigation of the phenomenon [Wertheimer, M. (1912). Experimentelle Studien uber das Sehen von Bewegung. Zeitschrift fur Psychologie, 61, 161-265], he mentions that voluntary attention can influence the way in which an ambiguous apparent motion display is perceived. But until now, few studies have investigated how strong the modulation of apparent motion through attention can be under different stimulus and task conditions. We used bistable motion quartets of two different sizes, where the perception of vertical and horizontal motion is equally likely. Eleven observers participated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to either (a) hold the current movement direction as long as possible, (b) passively view the stimulus, or (c) switch the movement directions as quickly as possible. With the respective instructions, observers could almost double phase durations in (a) and more than halve durations in (c) relative to the passive condition. This modulation effect was stronger for the large quartets. In Experiment 2, observers' attention was diverted from the stimulus by a detection task at fixation while they still had to report their conscious perception. This manipulation prolonged dominance durations for up to 100%. The experiments reveal a high susceptibility of ambiguous apparent motion to attentional modulation. We discuss how feature- and space-based attention mechanisms might contribute to those effects.},

	Abstract = {An object moving in discrete steps can appear to move continuously even along sections of the path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent motion display, which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded 2AFC task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers' reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent motion display is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, and that it is possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object's representation.},

When all objects abruptly disappeared and reappeared mid-trajectory, it was found that (a) subjects tracked better when objects reappeared at their loci of disappearance than when they reappeared in their extrapolated trajectories, (b) disappearance episodes ranging from 150 to 900 ms had virtually no differential effect on performance, (c) tracking deteriorated monotonically as a function of displacement magnitude during disappearance, and (d) tracking did not depend on whether objects moved in predictable paths. Even objects that reappeared backward in their trajectories were tracked dramatically better than objects that reappeared in their extrapolated trajectories. When all objects disappeared and reappeared in ways that implicated the presence of an occluder (i.e., with occlusion and disocclusion cues along fixed contours), tracking again was not predictive, and performance deteriorated with increased displacement. When objects reappeared predictably in 75% of trials, they were still tracked better when they reappeared at their points of disappearance. Theoretical implications of a non-predictive multiple object tracking mechanism are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In three experiments, subjects attempted to track multiple items as they moved independently and unpredictably about a display. Performance was not impaired when the items were briefly (but completely) occluded at various times during their motion, suggesting that occlusion is taken into account when computing enduring perceptual objecthood. Unimpaired performance required the presence of accretion and deletion cues along fixed contours at the occluding boundaries. Performance was impaired when items were present on the visual field at the same times and to the same degrees as in the occlusion conditions, but disappeared and reappeared in ways which did not implicate the presence of occluding surfaces (e.g., by imploding and exploding into and out of existence instead of accreting and deleting along a fixed contour). Unimpaired performance did not require visible occluders (i.e., Michotte's tunnel effect) or globally consistent occluder positions. We discuss implications of these results for theories of objecthood in visual attention.},

@article{Straube:1997nk,
	Abstract = {We adapted the saccadic gain (saccadic amplitude/target step amplitude) by requiring monkeys to track a small spot that stepped to one side by 5, 10, or 15 degrees and then, during the initial targeting saccade, jumped either forward or backward by a fixed percentage of the initial step. Saccadic gain increased or decreased, respectively, as a function of the number of adapting saccades made in that direction. The relation between gain and the number of adapting saccades was fit with an exponential function, yielding an asymptotic gain and a rate constant (the number of saccades to achieve 63% of the total change in gain). Backward intrasaccadic target jumps of 15, 30, and 50% of the initial target step reduced the asymptotic gain by an average of 12.2, 23.1, and 36.4%, respectively, with average rate constants of 163, 368, and 827 saccades, respectively. During 50% backward jumps, some saccades, especially those to larger target steps, became slower and lasted longer. Forward intrasaccadic jumps of 30% increased the asymptotic gain by 23.3% (average rate constant of 1,178 saccades). After we had caused adaptation, we induced recovery of gain toward normal by requiring the animal to track target steps without intrasaccadic jumps. Recovery following forward adaptation required about one third fewer saccades than the preceding gain increase. Recovery following backward adaptation required about the same average number of saccades as the preceding gain decrease. The first saccades of recovery were slightly less adapted than the last saccades of adaptation, suggesting that a small part of adaptation might have been strategic. After 50% backward jumps had reduced saccadic gain, the hypometric primary saccades during recovery were followed by hypometric corrective saccades, suggesting that they too had been adapted. When saccades of only one size underwent gain reduction, saccades to target steps of other amplitudes showed much less adaptation. Also, saccades in the direction opposite to that adapted were not adapted. Gain reductions endured if an adapted animal was placed in complete darkness for 20 h. These data indicate that saccadic gain adaptation is relatively specific to the adapted step and does not produce parametric changes of all saccades. Furthermore, adaptation is not a strategy, but involves enduring neuronal reorganization in the brain. We suggest that this paradigm engages mechanisms that determine saccadic gain in real life and therefore offers a reversible means to study their neuronal substrate.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation of the horizontal smooth pursuit eye movement was examined using step-ramp moving target paradigms in chronically prepared Macaca fuscata. Monkeys were trained to pursue a small target which moved in the horizontal plane in a 3 degrees step-10 degrees/s ramp or a 0 degrees step-10 degrees/s ramp mode for 300-400 ms. When the target moved from central fixation point in a step-ramp mode, the monkeys usually responded with an initial pursuit eye movement (latency, 100-120 ms) which reached to a nearly constant velocity of 4 degrees/s in 50 100 ms, followed by a 1-3.5 degrees catch-up saccade (latency, 170-230 ms). The catch-up saccade was followed by a 7-8 degrees/s post-saccadic pursuit. The post-saccadic pursuit velocity was measured 40-90 ms after the end of the catch-up saccade. When the target velocity was doubled (20 degrees/s) for 100-200 ms immediately after the onset of the catch-up saccade, the post-saccadic pursuit velocity increased by 40%. When the target velocity was decreased by half (5 degrees/s) immediately after the onset of the catch-up saccade for 150 ms, the post-saccadic pursuit velocity decreased by 30%. These increases or decreases of post-saccadic pursuit were observable within just 50-150 trials. The adaptation of post-saccadic pursuit occurred independent of the position of the target. The amplitude and latency of the catch-up saccade also increased correspondingly when the post-saccadic pursuit velocity was adaptively increased. Adaptation of smooth pursuit did not affect the dynamics of reflex eye movements, including the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR) gain and phase measured by 0.33 Hz-10 degrees (peak-to-peak) turntable oscillations in darkness. Conversely, adaptation of the HVOR gain induced by a 2 h sustained oscillation of the turntable and screen in reversed direction at 0.33 Hz-10 degrees affected little the velocity of post-saccadic pursuit or the amplitude of the catch-up saccade. These results suggest that different neural mechanisms are respectively involved for the adaptation of horizontal smooth pursuit and HVOR in the primate.},

@article{Wallman:1998ap,
	Abstract = {The brain maintains the accuracy of saccadic eye movements by adjusting saccadic amplitude relative to the target distance (i.e., saccade gain) on the basis of the performance of recent saccades. If an experimenter surreptitiously moves the target backward during each saccade, thereby causing the eyes to land beyond their targets, saccades undergo a gradual gain reduction. The error signal driving this conventional saccadic gain adaptation could be either visual (the postsaccadic distance of the target from the fovea) or motoric (the direction and size of the corrective saccade that brings the eye onto the back-stepped target). Similarly, the adaptation itself might be a motor adjustment (change in the size of saccade for a given perceived target distance) or a visual remapping (change in the perceived target distance). We studied these possibilities in experiments both with rhesus macaques and with humans. To test whether the error signal is motoric, we used a paradigm devised by Heiner Deubel. The Deubel paradigm differed from the conventional adaptation paradigm in that the backward step that occurred during the saccade was brief, and the target then returned to its original displaced location. This ploy replaced most of the usual backward corrective saccades with forward ones. Nevertheless, saccadic gain gradually decreased over hundreds of trials. Therefore, we conclude that the direction of saccadic gain adaptation is not determined by the direction of corrective saccades. To test whether gain adaptation is a manifestation of a static visual remapping, we decreased the gain of 10 degrees horizontal saccades by conventional adaptation and then tested the gain to targets appearing at retinal locations unused during adaptation. To make the target appear in such "virgin territory," we had it jump first vertically and then 10 degrees horizontally; both jumps were completed and the target spot extinguished before saccades were made sequentially to the remembered target locations. Conventional adaptation decreased the gain of the second, horizontal saccade even though the target was in a nonadapted retinal location. In contrast, the horizontal component of oblique saccades made directly to the same virgin location showed much less gain decrease, suggesting that the adaptation is specific to saccade direction rather than to target location. Thus visual remapping cannot account for the entire reduction of saccadic gain. We conclude that saccadic gain adaptation involves an error signal that is primarily visual, not motor, but that the adaptation itself is primarily motor, not visual.},

	Abstract = {In the flash-lag illusion, a moving object aligned with a flash is perceived to be offset in the direction of motion following the flash. In the ``flash-drag'' illusion, a flash is mislocalized in the direction of nearby motion. In the ``flash-jump'' illusion, a transient change in the appearance of a moving object (e.g., color) is mislocalized in the direction of subsequent motion. Finally, in the Frohlich illusion, the starting position of a suddenly appearing moving object is mislocalized in the direction of the subsequent motion. We demonstrate, in a series of experiments, a unified explanation for all these illusions: Perceptual localization is influenced by motion signals collected over ∼80 ms after a query is triggered. These demonstrations rule out ``latency difference'' and asynchronous feature binding models, in which objects appear in their real positions but misaligned in time. Instead, the illusions explored here are best understood as biases in localization caused by motion signals. We suggest that motion biasing exists because it allows the visual system to account for neural processing delays by retrospectively ``pushing'' an object closer to its true physical location, and we propose directions for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic updating of location by the activity of motion-sensitive neurons.},

	Abstract = {When a flash is presented in spatial alignment with a moving stimulus, the flash appears to lag behind (the flash-lag effect). The motion of the object can influence the position of the flash, but there may also be a reciprocal effect of the flash on the moving object. Here, we demonstrate that this is the case. We show that when a flash is presented near the moving object, the flash-lag effect does not depend greatly on the duration of the preflash trajectory. However, when the flash is presented sufficiently far from the moving object, the flash-lag effect increases with the duration of the preflash trajectory, until it reaches an asymptotic level. We also show that the interaction of the near flash can occur when it is task irrelevant. Finally, using the motion aftereffect, we demonstrate that motion signals are involved in the time evolution of the flash-lag effect.},

@article{Snowden:1998zl,
	Abstract = {Where do we perceive an object to be when it is moving? Nijhawan {$[$}1{$]$} has reported that if a stationary test pattern is briefly flashed in spatial alignment with a moving one, the moving element actually appears displaced in the direction in which it is moving. Nijhawan postulates that this may be the result of a mechanism that predicts the future position of the moving element so as to compensate for the fact that the element will have moved position from the time at which the light left it to the time at which the observer becomes aware of it (as a result of the finite time taken for neural transmission). There is an alternative explanation of this effect, however. Changes in the stimulus presentation could affect perceptual latency [2], and therefore the perceived position if in motion (as suggested for the Pulfrich pendulum effect [3] [4]). In other words, if the flashed probe of the Nijhawan demonstration takes longer to reach perceptual awareness than the moving stimulus, the latter will appear to be ahead of the probe. Here, I demonstrate an alternative way of testing this hypothesis. When an illusory movement is induced (via the motion aftereffect) within a stationary pattern, it can be shown that this also produces a change in its perceived spatial position. As the pattern is stationary, one cannot account for this result via the notion of perceptual lags.},

	Annote = {"However, even the identification of the motion-sensitive region in the ITS as the human homolog of MT/V5 may be premature. Monkey MT/V5 is joined by several satellites (Fig. 83.3) which are themselves selective for motion (Desimone and Ungerleider, 1986; for review see Orban, 1997). Thus, the human motion-sensitive region in the ITS may well correspond to the entire complex, including MT/V5 and its satellites, as suggested by DeYoe et al. (1996). This view has become generally accepted, and the region is referred to as hMT/V5+. Several authors have attempted to subdivide the complex using known properties of MST neurons: large ipsilateral overlap (Desimone and Ungerleider, 1986; Raiguel et al., 1997), responsiveness to optic flow patterns (Duffy and Wurtz, 1991; Lagae et al., 1994; Saito et al., 1986), and response during pursuit (Komatsu and Wurtz, 1988). hMT/V5+ responds to ipsilateral stimulation (Brandt et al., 2000; Ffytche et al., 2000; Tootell et al., 1998; Tootell et al., 1995b). Morrone et al. (2000) suggested that the parts of the hMT/V5+ complex that respond to translation and optic flow components are distinct entities. The part responsive to optic flow, presumed to be the homolog of MSTd, is located more ventrally and appears only when the flow stimuli are changing in time. This localization is in agreement with the results of an earlier passive study of optic flow by de Jong et al. (1994) and with these of a study from our group (Peuskens et al., 2001a) investigating the neural correlates of heading judgments based on optical flow. Both studies observed activity in a ventral satellite of hMT/V5+ related to expansion/contraction. On the other hand, Dukelow et al. (2001), using ipsilateral overlap and pursuit in the dark, reached a different conclusion: according to these authors, MSTd and MSTl are located anterior to MT/V5 proper in the human complex. This contradiction illustrates the difficulty of relating human imaging to monkey single-cell properties.

The recent study of Vanduffel et al. (2001) in the awake monkey makes this even more clear. Up to now, the hMT/V5 complex was believed to include homologs of the subregions of MST, in addition to MT/V5. Yet, when using the translating random-dot pattern typically used in human studies (Sunaert et al., 1999) in monkeys, Vanduffel et al. (2001) observed motion sensitivity in MT/V5, of course, as well as in MSTv and in FST, but not in MSTd (Figs. 83.3, 83.4). The advent of monkey fMRI has made it possible to identify the satellites in the human complex properly. One should scan the human complex at high resolution and test stimuli that differentiate the various parts of the motion complex in monkey fMRI. The aggregation of several functional regions into a single-motion complex may also explain some of the variability in its localization (Watson et al., 1993). As expected from single-cell studies, monkey MT/V5 was activated (above baseline) by both stationary and moving stimuli, but more so by motion. This activation translates into MR signals of opposite polarity in the standard BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) fMRI and in contrast-enhanced fMRI, using MION (monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle) as the contrast agent (Fig. 83.4)."},

	Abstract = {Robust perception of self-motion requires integration of visual motion signals with nonvisual cues. Neurons in the dorsal subdivision of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) may be involved in this sensory integration, because they respond selectively to global patterns of optic flow, as well as translational motion in darkness. Using a virtual-reality system, we have characterized the three-dimensional (3D) tuning of MSTd neurons to heading directions defined by optic flow alone, inertial motion alone, and congruent combinations of the two cues. Among 255 MSTd neurons, 98% exhibited significant 3D heading tuning in response to optic flow, whereas 64% were selective for heading defined by inertial motion. Heading preferences for visual and inertial motion could be aligned but were just as frequently opposite. Moreover, heading selectivity in response to congruent visual/vestibular stimulation was typically weaker than that obtained using optic flow alone, and heading preferences under congruent stimulation were dominated by the visual input. Thus, MSTd neurons generally did not integrate visual and nonvisual cues to achieve better heading selectivity. A simple two-layer neural network, which received eye-centered visual inputs and head-centered vestibular inputs, reproduced the major features of the MSTd data. The network was trained to compute heading in a head-centered reference frame under all stimulus conditions, such that it performed a selective reference-frame transformation of visual, but not vestibular, signals. The similarity between network hidden units and MSTd neurons suggests that MSTd may be an early stage of sensory convergence involved in transforming optic flow information into a (head-centered) reference frame that facilitates integration with vestibular signals.},

@article{Fetsch:2007sy,
	Abstract = {Heading perception is a complex task that generally requires the integration of visual and vestibular cues. This sensory integration is complicated by the fact that these two modalities encode motion in distinct spatial reference frames (visual, eye-centered; vestibular, head-centered). Visual and vestibular heading signals converge in the primate dorsal subdivision of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd), a region thought to contribute to heading perception, but the reference frames of these signals remain unknown. We measured the heading tuning of MSTd neurons by presenting optic flow (visual condition), inertial motion (vestibular condition), or a congruent combination of both cues (combined condition). Static eye position was varied from trial to trial to determine the reference frame of tuning (eye-centered, head-centered, or intermediate). We found that tuning for optic flow was predominantly eye-centered, whereas tuning for inertial motion was intermediate but closer to head-centered. Reference frames in the two unimodal conditions were rarely matched in single neurons and uncorrelated across the population. Notably, reference frames in the combined condition varied as a function of the relative strength and spatial congruency of visual and vestibular tuning. This represents the first investigation of spatial reference frames in a naturalistic, multimodal condition in which cues may be integrated to improve perceptual performance. Our results compare favorably with the predictions of a recent neural network model that uses a recurrent architecture to perform optimal cue integration, suggesting that the brain could use a similar computational strategy to integrate sensory signals expressed in distinct frames of reference.},

@article{Dursteler:1988ta,
	Abstract = {1. Previous experiments have shown that punctate chemical lesions within the middle temporal area (MT) of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) produce deficits in the initiation and maintenance of pursuit eye movements (10, 34). The present experiments were designed to test the effect of such chemical lesions in an area within the STS to which MT projects, the medial superior temporal area (MST). 2. We injected ibotenic acid into localized regions of MST, and we observed two deficits in pursuit eye movements, a retinotopic deficit and a directional deficit. 3. The retinotopic deficit in pursuit initiation was characterized by the monkey's inability to match eye speed to target speed or to adjust the amplitude of the saccade made to acquire the target to compensate for target motion. This deficit was related to the initiation of pursuit to targets moving in any direction in the visual field contralateral to the side of the brain with the lesion. This deficit was similar to the deficit we found following damage to extrafoveal MT except that the affected area of the visual field frequently extended throughout the entire contralateral visual field tested. 4. The directional deficit in pursuit maintenance was characterized by a failure to match eye speed to target speed once the fovea had been brought near the moving target. This deficit occurred only when the target was moving toward the side of the lesion, regardless of whether the target began to move in the ipsilateral or contralateral visual field. There was no deficit in the amplitude of saccades made to acquire the target, or in the amplitude of the catch-up saccades made to compensate for the slowed pursuit. The directional deficit is similar to the one we described previously following chemical lesions of the foveal representation in the STS. 5. Retinotopic deficits resulted from any of our injections in MST. Directional deficits resulted from lesions limited to subregions within MST, particularly lesions that invaded the floor of the STS and the posterior bank of the STS just lateral to MT. Extensive damage to the densely myelinated area of the anterior bank or to the posterior parietal area on the dorsal lip of the anterior bank produced minimal directional deficits. 6. We conclude that damage to visual motion processing in MST underlies the retinotopic pursuit deficit just as it does in MT. MST appears to be a sequential step in visual motion processing that occurs before all of the visual motion information is transmitted to the brainstem areas related to pursuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {We have used antidromic activation to determine the functional discharge properties of neurons that project to the frontal pursuit area (FPA) from the medial-superior temporal visual area (MST). In awake rhesus monkeys, MST neurons were considered to be activated antidromically if they emitted action potentials at fixed, short latencies after stimulation in the FPA and if the activation passed the collision test. Antidromically activated neurons (n = 37) and a sample of the overall population of MST neurons (n = 110) then were studied during pursuit eye movements across a dark background and during laminar motion of a large random-dot texture and optic flow expansion and contraction during fixation. Antidromically activated neurons showed direction tuning during pursuit (25/37), during laminar image motion (21/37), or both (16/37). Of 27 neurons tested with optic flow stimuli, 14 showed tuning for optic flow expansion (n = 10) or contraction (n = 4). There were no statistically significant differences in the response properties of the antidromically activated and control samples. Preferred directions for pursuit and laminar image motion did not show any statistically significant biases, and the preferred directions for eye versus image motion in each sample tended to be equally divided between aligned and opposed. There were small differences between the control and antidromically activated populations in preferred speeds for laminar motion and optic flow; these might have reached statistical significance with larger samples of antidromically activated neurons. We conclude that the population of MST neurons projecting to the FPA is highly diverse and quite similar to the general population of neurons in MST.},

	Abstract = {The motion areas of posterior parietal cortex extract information on visual motion for perception as well as for the guidance of movement. It is usually assumed that neurons in posterior parietal cortex represent visual motion relative to the retina. Current models describing action guided by moving objects work successfully based on this assumption. However, here we show that the pursuit-related responses of a distinct group of neurons in area MST of monkeys are at odds with this view. Rather than signaling object image motion on the retina, they represent object motion in world-centered coordinates. This representation may simplify the coordination of object-directed action and ego motion-invariant visual perception.},

	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that middle temporal (MT) and middle superior temporal (MST) cortical areas in the brain of rhesus monkeys are essential for processing visual motion. We asked whether this assumption holds true if the moving stimulus consists of a second-order motion stimulus. In addition, we asked whether neurons in area MT and MST code for moving sound sources. To answer these questions, we trained three rhesus monkeys on a direction-discrimination task. Our monkeys were able to correctly report the direction of all motion stimuli used in this study. Firing rates of directionally selective neurons from area MT (n = 38) and MST (n = 68) were recorded during task performance. These neurons coded only for the stimulus movement if the motion stimulus was separated from the background by luminance or flicker (Fourier and drift-balanced motion). If these segregation cues were absent (in the case of theta motion and of the moving sound source), firing rates did not code for the stimulus' direction. Therefore we conclude that although areas MT and MST are undoubtedly involved in processing a moving stimulus, they are not the final cortical stages responsible for perceiving it.},

@article{Britten:1998yo,
	Abstract = {Ever since being described by Mountcastle (Mountcastle, 1957), columnar organization of sensory cortical areas has provided key leverage into understanding the functional organization of neocortex. Columnar or clustered organization of neurons sharing like properties is now known to be widespread, and probably universal in primary sensory areas. Visual cortex in primates consists of a primary area and a large number of secondary areas, which are organized in a manner both hierarchical and parallel (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991; Young, 1993; Young et al., 1995). One major component in the organization of extrastriate visual cortex appears to be the division into dorsal and ventral "streams" of processing (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982), each of which is organized hierarchically. Within each, columnar organization exists at early stages, but becomes less clear at higher levels. Columnar organization has been described at the highest level of the ventral stream, inferotemporal cortex (IT, Saleem et al., 1993; Fujita & Fujita, 1996; Tanaka, 1996), but has not been well characterized at the higher levels of the dorsal stream. Hints of such organization are found in the literature (Saito et al., 1986; Lagae et al., 1994), but systematic measurements are needed. In this paper, I report the existence of clustered organization in the medial superior temporal area (MST) of the dorsal stream, which is arguably the highest dominantly visual area on this pathway. I have measured the selectivity of both single- and multiple-unit activity along oblique electrode penetrations through this area to three different kinds of optic flow stimuli, and find that nearby neurons are more similar in their tuning than are more distant ones. This observation documents the existence of some form of clustered organization and supports the importance of this area in the processing of optic flow information.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies in rhesus monkeys and human patients have increased our understanding of the role of various cortical regions in the generation of smooth pursuit eye movements. Little is known, though, about the cerebral white matter pathways mediating smooth pursuit. In this paper, we describe both the corticocortical and corticosubcortical projections from areas in the monkey brain known to be involved in smooth pursuit. The corticocortical pathways within one hemisphere consist of a sequence of arcuate fiber bundles interconnecting (1) striate cortex with an area in occipitoparietal cortex called the middle temporal (MT) area, (2) area MT with two areas in parietal cortex called the medial superior temporal (MST) and posterior parietal (PP) areas, and (3) area MST with area PP. An interhemispheric pathway interconnecting areas MT and MST consists of fibers sequentially passing through the tapetum, major forceps, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The corticosubcortical pathway from area MST to the pontine nuclei and accessory optic system consists of fibers sequentially running through the internal sagittal stratum, the retrolenticular part of the internal sagittal stratum, and the cerebral peduncle. Based on the effects of lesions on pursuit eye movements, these corticocortical and corticosubcortical projections can be divided into sensory, motor, and attentional/spatial systems. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that homologous systems exist in the human cerebrum.},

@article{Boussaoud:1990bq,
	Abstract = {To identify the cortical connections of the medial superior temporal (MST) and fundus of the superior temporal (FST) visual areas in the extrastriate cortex of the macaque, we injected multiple tracers, both anterograde and retrograde, in each of seven macaques under physiological control. We found that, in addition to connections with each other, both MST and FST have widespread connections with visual and polysensory areas in posterior prestriate, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex. In prestriate cortex, both areas have connections with area V3A. MST alone has connections with the far peripheral field representations of V1 and V2, the parieto-occipital (PO) visual area, and the dorsal prelunate area (DP), whereas FST alone has connections with area V4 and the dorsal portion of area V3. Within the caudal superior temporal sulcus, both areas have extensive connections with the middle temporal area (MT), MST alone has connections with area PP, and FST alone has connections with area V4t. In the rostral superior temporal sulcus, both areas have extensive connections with the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) in the upper bank of the sulcus and with area IPa in the sulcal floor. FST also has connections with the cortex in the lower bank of the sulcus, involving area TEa. In the parietal cortex, both the central field representation of MST and FST have connections with the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas, whereas MST alone has connections with the inferior parietal gyrus. In the temporal cortex, the central field representation of MST as well as FST has connections with visual area TEO and cytoarchitectonic area TF. In the frontal cortex, both MST and FST have connections with the frontal eye field. On the basis of the laminar pattern of anterograde and retrograde label, it was possible to classify connections as forward, backward, or intermediate and thereby place visual areas into a cortical hierarchy. In general, MST and FST receive forward inputs from prestriate visual areas, have intermediate connections with parietal areas, and project forward to the frontal eye field and areas in the rostral superior temporal sulcus. Because of the strong inputs to MST and FST from area MT, an area known to play a role in the analysis of visual motion, and because MST and FST themselves have high proportions of directionally selective cells, they appear to be important stations in a cortical motion processing system.},

@article{Churchland:2005wj,
	Abstract = {We have isolated extraretinal and retinal components of firing during smooth pursuit eye movements in the medial-superior-temporal area (MST) in the extrastriate visual cortex. Awake macaque monkeys tracked spots in total darkness to eliminate image motion inputs from the background. For 300 ms during sustained tracking at different speeds, the target was stabilized on the moving eye, practically eliminating image motion inputs from the tracking target. The extraretinal component of firing rate during image stabilization was direction selective and related to eye speed but sometimes showed a different preferred speed from the retinal component of the same neuron's responses. The highly variable firing rate of individual MST neurons allowed an ideal observer to predict target speed correctly on 25% of trials. Pooling the data from 71 MST neurons improved the correct response rate to 50%. Behavioral experiments imposed brief perturbations of target velocity to assess the gain of visual-motor transmission for pursuit. The average response to perturbations increased as a function of target speed. However, the size of the responses to individual perturbations allowed an ideal observer to predict target speed correctly on only 35% of the trials. The imprecision of MST responses argues that the output of MST may be a poor candidate to drive eye velocity and so may instead regulate another component of pursuit. The good agreement between the eye velocity precision of the behavioral responses to perturbations of target motion and the firing of MST neurons raises regulation of the visual-motor gain of pursuit as one candidate component.},

@article{Takemura:2006tx,
	Abstract = {Movements of the visual scene evoke short latency ocular following responses (OFRs) in monkeys that are mediated at least in part by the medial superior temporal area of the cortex (MST). It is known that the sensitivity of the OFR to motion is transiently enhanced immediately after a saccade and this post-saccadic enhancement is largely secondary to visual reafference during the antecedent saccade. As part of an investigation of the neural basis of this post-saccadic enhancement, we examined the dependence of OFR-related neuronal activity in MST on the post-saccadic delay interval in alert monkeys (Macaca fuscata). Large-field motion stimuli were applied either 50 or 150 ms after a centering saccade and response measures were based on the initial (open-loop) changes in (a) eye position and (b) discharge rate. Of the 67% of MST neurons whose OFR-related activity showed significant dependence on the post-saccadic delay, 91% mirrored the OFR, showing higher sensitivity to motion at the shorter post-saccadic delay interval. However, the sensitivity of OFR-related neurons in MST to post-saccadic delay varied considerably from cell to cell and, on average, was 79.6% of that shown by the OFR. We suggest that this enhanced OFR-related activity in the wake of a saccade is causally linked to the visually based post-saccadic enhancement of the OFR.},

	Abstract = {To examine the subcortical connections of the medial superior temporal and fundus of the superior temporal visual areas (MST and FST, respectively), we injected anterograde and retrograde tracers into 16 physiologically identified sites within the two areas in seven macaque monkeys. The subcortical connections of MST and FST were found to be very similar. Both areas were found to be reciprocally connected with the pulvinar, mainly with its medial subdivision, and with the claustrum. Nonreciprocal projections from both MST and FST were consistently found in the striatum (caudate and putamen), reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the pontine nuclei. The labeled terminals in the pons were in the dorsolateral, lateral, dorsal, and peduncular nuclei. Additional nonreciprocal projections were found in one MST and one FST case to the nucleus of the optic tract, and, in one FST case, to the lateral terminal nucleus. Finally, three cases showed a nonreciprocal projection to FST from the basal forebrain. The subcortical structures containing label following MST and FST injections were largely the same as those labeled after injections of the middle temporal visual area (MT), but the label within each structure after MST and FST injections was more widespread than that from MT, overlapping the distribution of label that has been reported after injections of parietal visual areas. This finding is consistent with the known contributions of MST and FST to the functions of parietal cortex, such as eye-movement control.},

	Abstract = {
The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode- 
Shannon representation of random processes and the ``state transition'' method of 
analysis of dynamic systems.  New results are: 
(1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- 
tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- 
memory filters.  
(2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance 
matrix of the optimal estimation error.  From the solution of this equation the co- 
efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- 
tained without further calculations. 
(3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. 
The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming 
and extending earlier results.  
The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic 
concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.

@article{Michel:2008bs,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated that people often integrate information from multiple perceptual cues in a statistically optimal manner when judging properties of surfaces in a scene. For example, subjects typically weight the information based on each cue to a degree that is inversely proportional to the variance of the distribution of a scene property given a cue's value. We wanted to determine whether subjects similarly use information about the reliabilities of arbitrary low-level visual features when making image-based discriminations, as in visual texture discrimination. To investigate this question, we developed a modification of the classification image technique and conducted two experiments that explored subjects' discrimination strategies using this improved technique. We created a basis set consisting of 20 low-level features and created stimuli by linearly combining the basis vectors. Subjects were trained to discriminate between two prototype signals corrupted with Gaussian feature noise. When we analyzed subjects' classification images over time, we found that they modified their decision strategies in a manner consistent with optimal feature integration, giving greater weight to reliable features and less weight to unreliable features. We conclude that optimal integration is not a characteristic specific to conventional visual cues or to judgments involving three-dimensional scene properties. Rather, just as researchers have previously demonstrated that people are sensitive to the reliabilities of conventionally defined cues when judging the depth or slant of a surface, we demonstrate that they are likewise sensitive to the reliabilities of arbitrary low-level features when making image-based discriminations.},

@article{Lamouret:2001ad,
	Abstract = {Local motion detectors can only provide the velocity component perpendicular to a moving line that crosses their receptive field, leading to an ambiguity known as the "aperture problem". This problem is solved exactly for rigid objects translating in the screen plane via the intersection of constraints (IOC). In natural scenes, however, object motions are not restricted to fronto-parallel translations, and several objects with distinct motions may be present in the visual space. Under these conditions the usual IOC construction is no longer valid, which raises questions as its use as a basis for spatial integration and selection of motion signals in uniform and non-uniform velocity fields. The influence of the motion of random dots on the perceived direction of a horizontal line grating was measured, when dots and lines are seen through different apertures. The random dots were mapped on a plane that translates in a fronto-parallel plane (uniform 2D translation) or in depth (3D, corresponding to a non-uniform projected velocity field, either expanding or contracting). The grating was either moving rigidly with the dots or in the opposite direction. Subjects' responses show that the direction of line grating movement was reliably influenced only in conditions consistent with rigid motion; where there was a reliable influence, the perceived direction was consistent with the dot motion pattern. This finding points to the existence of a motion-based selection mechanism that operates prior to the disambiguation of the line movement direction. Disambiguation could occur for both uniform and non-uniform velocity fields, even though in the last case none of the individual dots indicated the proper direction in 2D velocity space. Finally, the capture by non-uniform motion patterns was less robust than that by uniform 2D translations, and could be disrupted by manipulations of the shape and size of the apertures.},

	Abstract = {We studied smooth-pursuit eye movements elicited by first- and second-order motion stimuli. Stimuli were random dot fields whose contrast was modulated by a Gaussian window with a space constant of 0.5 degrees. For the first-order stimuli, the random dots simply moved across the screen at the same speed as the window; for the second-order stimuli the window moved across stationary or randomly flickering dots. Additional stimuli which combined first- and second-order motion cues were used to determine the degree and type of interaction found between the two types of motion stimuli. Measurements were made at slow (1 degrees/s) and moderate (6 degrees/s) target speeds. At a velocity of 1 degrees/s the initiation, transition, and steady-state phases of smooth pursuit in response to second-order motion targets are severely affected when compared with the smooth pursuit of first-order motion targets. At a velocity of 6 degrees/s there is a small but significant deficit in steady-state pursuit of second-order motion targets but not much effect on pursuit initiation.},

@article{Rashbass:1961la,
	Abstract = {Dodge (1903) gave the first comprehensive description of the types of 
eye movement which can occur. Since that time there has been repeated 
confirmation that when the eyes follow moving objects they make two 
types of movement: jerky movements, called saccadic movements, and 
smooth movements in the intervals between these. Westheimer (1954a, b) 
has analysed the saccadic movements and shown them to be the response 
to simultaneous rapid changes in innervation to the eye muscles involved. 
The nature of the movement is determined largely by the mechanical 
properties of the structures in the orbit. 
The smooth movements have been described by several workers. Dodge, 
Travis & Fox (1930) investigated the movements obtained when tracking 
black and white vertical bars moving horizontally across the visual 
field-opto-kinetic nystagmus-in man, and also the response to a 'slit' 
of light moving from side to side with simple harmonic motion; Rademaker 
& Ter Braak (1948) described opto-kinetic nystagmus in rabbits; West- 
heimer (1954b) investigated the response to the horizontal movement of a 
single spot of light with uniform velocity, harmonic motion, random motion, 
and with uniform velocity exposed intermittently. 
There are three questions which have not been satisfactorily answered 
by these investigations on tracking movements. First, what decides 
whether the eyes should perform a saccadic movement or a smooth move- 
ment? Secondly, in what way are smooth movements metrically related 
to the movement of the target? Thirdly, are saccadic movements and 
smooth tracking movements different modes of action of the same neuro- 
logical apparatus, or are different pathways involved? 
What decides whether the eyes should perform a saccadic movement or 
a smooth movement? There is abundant evidence that when the target is 
stationary and does not lie in the line of sight, fixation is achieved by one 
or more saccadic movements. Smooth movements are only elicited when 
the image of the target moves smoothly over the retina. The association 
between the movement of the image over the retina and smooth tracking 
eye movements has led to the assertion (e.g. Walsh, 1957) that the move-
ment of the image is the stimulus which evokes smooth tracking, although 
the evidence is insufficient to justify this conclusion. The evidence available 
is equally compatible with the view that both saccadic and smooth move- 
ments are caused by positional errors in fixation, but that smooth move- 
ments occur only when there is no discontinuity in the position of the 
target. Evidence will be presented here that it is indeed the movement of 
the image over the retina which is detected and measured, and results in a 
smooth tracking response. 
In what way are smooth eye movements metrically related to the move- 
ment of the target? Dodge et al. (1930) have shown that the maximum 
speed of movement of the target which can be adequately tracked is about 
30-40$\,^{\circ}$/sec. This has been confirmed by Westheimer. However, no detailed 
observations have been reported which relate the way in which the final 
tracking speed is reached from an initial state of rest, to the speed of the 
target. It will be shown here that the speed of the target determines the 
rate at which the final tracking speed is reached. Such observations are of 
importance because they throw light on the way in which information 
about how the target moves is utilized to produce an appropriate 
response. 
Are saccadic movements and smooth tracking movements different 
modes of action of the same neurological apparatus, or not? The pathways 
involved in fixation and tracking have not been successfully identified. It 
is not clear whether the cortex is necessarily involved in these movements. 
Stimulation and ablation experiments reported in the literature have given 
confficting results, and the nature of the movements is rarely reported. 
The possibility exists that some information can be gleaned from the way 
drugs influence tracking responses. It will be shown that saccadic and 
smooth movements may be differentially affected by drugs. 
This paper presents a re-examination of the eye-movement responses to 
horizontally moving targets, with particular emphasis on these three 
questions.

@article{Steinman:2000ap,
	Abstract = {Max Wertheimer (1880--1943), the founder of the Gestalt School of Psychology, published a monograph on the perception of apparent motion in 1912, which initiated a new direction for a great deal of subsequent perceptual theory and research. Wertheimer's research was inspired by a serendipitous observation of a pure apparent movement, which he called the phi-phenomenon to distinguish it from optimal apparent movement (β), which resembles real movement. Wertheimer called his novel observation `pure' because it was perceived in the absence of any object being seen to change its position in space. The phi-phenomenon, as well as the best conditions for seeing it, were not described clearly in this monograph, leading to considerable subsequent confusion about its appearance and occurrence. We review the history leading to the discovery of the phi-phenomenon, and then describe: (i) a likely source for the confusion evident in most contemporary research on the phi-phenomenon; (ii) the best conditions for seeing the phi-phenomenon; (iii) new conditions that provide a particularly vivid phi-phenomenon; and (iv) two lines of thought that may provide explanations of the phi-phenomenon and also distinguish phi from β.},

Each stage computes a weighted linear sum of inputs, followed by rectification and divisive normalization. V1 receptive field weights are designed for orientation and direction selectivity. MT receptive field weights are designed for velocity (both speed and direction) selectivity. The paper includes computational simulations accounting for a wide range of physiological data, and describes experiments that could be used to further test and refine the model.},

	Abstract = {In order to see the world with high spatial acuity, an animal must sample the visual image with many detectors that restrict their analyses to extremely small regions of space. The visual cortex must then integrate the information from these localized receptive fields to obtain a more global picture of the surrounding environment. We studied this process in single neurons within the middle temporal visual area (MT) of macaques using stimuli that produced conflicting local and global information about stimulus motion. Neuronal responses in alert animals initially reflected predominantly the ambiguous local motion features, but gradually converged to an unambiguous global representation. When the same animals were anaesthetized, the integration of local motion signals was markedly impaired even though neuronal responses remained vigorous and directional tuning characteristics were intact. Our results suggest that anaesthesia preferentially affects the visual processing responsible for integrating local signals into a global visual representation.},

@article{Wallace:2005vl,
	Abstract = {Pursuing an object with smooth eye movements requires an accurate estimate of its two-dimensional (2D) trajectory. This 2D motion computation requires that different local motion measurements are extracted and combined to recover the global object-motion direction and speed. Several combination rules have been proposed such as vector averaging (VA), intersection of constraints (IOC), or 2D feature tracking (2DFT). To examine this computation, we investigated the time course of smooth pursuit eye movements driven by simple objects of different shapes. For type II diamond (where the direction of true object motion is dramatically different from the vector average of the 1-dimensional edge motions, i.e., VA not equal IOC = 2DFT), the ocular tracking is initiated in the vector average direction. Over a period of less than 300 ms, the eye-tracking direction converges on the true object motion. The reduction of the tracking error starts before the closing of the oculomotor loop. For type I diamonds (where the direction of true object motion is identical to the vector average direction, i.e., VA = IOC = 2DFT), there is no such bias. We quantified this effect by calculating the direction error between responses to types I and II and measuring its maximum value and time constant. At low contrast and high speeds, the initial bias in tracking direction is larger and takes longer to converge onto the actual object-motion direction. This effect is attenuated with the introduction of more 2D information to the extent that it was totally obliterated with a texture-filled type II diamond. These results suggest a flexible 2D computation for motion integration, which combines all available one-dimensional (edge) and 2D (feature) motion information to refine the estimate of object-motion direction over time.},

@article{Majaj:2007ge,
	Abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in primary visual cortex have small receptive fields that encode the motions of local features. These motions often differ from the motion of the object to which they belong and must therefore be integrated elsewhere. A candidate site for this integration is visual cortical area MT (V5), in which cells with large receptive fields compute the motion of patterns. Previous studies of motion integration in MT have used stimuli that fill the receptive field, and thus do not test whether motion information is really integrated across this whole area. For each MT neuron, we identified two regions ("patches") within the receptive field that were approximately equally effective in driving responses. We then measured responses to plaids whose component gratings overlapped within a patch, and compared them with responses to the same component gratings presented in separate patches. Cells that were selective for the direction of motion of the whole pattern when the gratings overlapped lost this selectivity when the gratings were separated and became selective instead for the direction of motion of the individual components. If MT cells simply pooled all of the inputs that endow them with a receptive field, they would encode all of the motions in the receptive field as belonging to a single object. Our results indicate instead that critical elements of the computations underlying pattern-direction selectivity in MT are done locally, on a scale smaller than the whole receptive field.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in area MT (V5) are selective for the direction of visual motion. In addition, many are selective for the motion of complex patterns independent of the orientation of their components, a behavior not seen in earlier visual areas. We show that the responses of MT cells can be captured by a linear-nonlinear model that operates not on the visual stimulus, but on the afferent responses of a population of nonlinear V1 cells. We fit this cascade model to responses of individual MT neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in MT. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

	Abstract = {The visual system evolved to process natural images, and the goal of visual neuroscience is to understand the computations it uses to do this. Indeed the goal of any theory of visual function is a model that will predict responses to any stimulus, including natural scenes. It has, however, recently become common to take this fundamental principle one step further: trying to use photographic or cinematographic representations of natural scenes (natural stimuli) as primary probes to explore visual computations. This approach is both challenging and controversial, and we argue that this use of natural images is so fraught with difficulty that it is not useful. Traditional methods for exploring visual computations that use artificial stimuli with carefully selected properties have been and continue to be the most effective tools for visual neuroscience. The proper use of natural stimuli is to test models based on responses to these synthetic stimuli, not to replace them.},

	Abstract = {Voluntary attention is the top-down selection process that focuses cortical processing resources on the most relevant sensory information. Spatial attention--that is, selection based on stimulus position--alters neuronal responsiveness throughout primate visual cortex. It has been hypothesized that it also changes receptive field profiles by shifting their centers toward attended locations and by shrinking them around attended stimuli. Here we examined, at high resolution, receptive fields in cortical area MT of rhesus macaque monkeys when their attention was directed to different locations within and outside these receptive fields. We found a shift of receptive fields, even far from the current location of attention, accompanied by a small amount of shrinkage. Thus, already in early extrastriate cortex, receptive fields are not static entities but are highly modifiable, enabling the dynamic allocation of processing resources to attended locations and supporting enhanced perception within the focus of attention by effectively increasing the local cortical magnification.},

@article{Klein:1985rz,
	Abstract = {Bisection thresholds were measured as a function of the separation of the lines. For separations of less than 1.5 min, the addition of flanking lines facilitates bisection so that thresholds of less than 1 sec for discriminating the direction of offset could be reliably obtained. For larger separations an interval could be bisected to an accuracy of 1 part in 60. Experiments varying the length, luminance, and overlap of the lines suggest that different cues are used in these two regimes. A dual space-size analysis is presented that can account for these bisection thresholds over a wide range of experimental conditions. This quantitative analysis produces viewprints of the stimuli (analogous to the voiceprint of audition). Each viewprint shows the output of many spatial filters of different positions and sizes. A new filter shape is introduced that has advantages for modeling the visual system. The sensitivity of each filter is fixed by the contrast-response function. The analysis further shows that the limiting factors in spatial hyperacuity are both the contrast-response function and the spatial grain.},

@article{Harwood:2008pi,
	Abstract = {We have previously shown that when a stimulus consisting of 2 concentric rings moves, saccade latencies are much longer (by 150ms) when attention is directed to the larger ring than to the smaller ring. Here, we investigated whether this effect can be explained by a deferral of the 'cost' of making a saccade while the target remains inside the attentional field, or by purely visual factors (eccentricity or contrast). We found 1) Latencies were shorter when attention was directed to small features irrespective of retinal eccentricity. 2) Saccade latency distributions were systematically determined by the ratio between the amplitude of the stimulus step and the diameter of the attended ring: Stimulus steps that were larger than the attended ring resulted in short latencies, whereas steps smaller than the attended ring resulted in proportionally longer and more variable latencies. 3) This effect was not seen in manual reaction times to the same target movement. 4) Supra-threshold changes in the contrast of targets, mimicking possible attentional effects on perceived contrast and saliency, had little effect on latency. We argue that the spatial scale of attention determines the urgency of saccade motor preparation processes by changing the rate and rate-variability of the underlying decision signal, in order to defer the cost of saccades that result in little visual benefit.},

	Abstract = {The diffusion decision model allows detailed explanations of behavior in two-choice discrimination tasks. In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data-accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions-into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

	Abstract = {Figure 1: where is MST in this picture? Shouldn't it have something colored in with smooth pursuit?

"Thus, FEF does not directly control the extraocular musculature, but instead achieves its purposes by triggering and modulating the brainstem circuitry of the much older image stabilization system, that is, the circuits underlying the reflexive eye movements that serve to hold the whole visual world stationary on the retina."

"Monkeys with FEF lesions fail to generate predictive saccades during square-wave target motion (Bruce and Borden, 1986), as do humans with FEF lesions (Gaymard et al., 1999)."

What about other kinds of predictive motion?

"Figure 96.7 shows that the aggregate PSB magnitude for the memory saccade is nearly identical to the PSB magnitude for the deferred saccades and is only slightly smaller than the PSB on the step-saccade task. This equality is particularly unexpected in light of a similar comparison recently carried out in the SC by Edelman and Goldberg (2001). They found that many SC burster cells did not respond in conjunction with memory saccades or responded much less than on their version of the deferred-saccade task."

so far none of this sounds different from LIP?

Maybe remapping? "This behavior is remarkable in that the vector of the second saccade is radically different from the vector from the fovea to the second light that the visual system registered."

Ah, herer. "The PSBs of some FEF neurons evidence this velocity-predictive process, indicating that target motion information is being utilized (Shi et al., 1995) and also that some visual activity in FEF was remapped by target velocity, which could provide targeting for the predictive PSB activity. Interestingly, the SC does not seem to provide such a predictive signal (Keller et al., 1996)."

"The critical step in this sensorimotor transformation underlying pursuit is provided by neurons that respond to target motion, but only (or principally) when and if the target is selected for foveation/pursuit. The smooth pursuit zone of FEF is a candidate site."},

	Abstract = {We studied how object speed is reconstructed from the responses of motion-selective cells for the generation of a behavior that is tightly linked to the speed of visual motion. In theory, the speed of an object could be estimated either from the speed tuning of the active population of motion-selective cells or from the rate of displacement of activation across the cortical map of visual space. We measured the pursuit eye movements evoked by stimuli containing two conflicting motion components: a local component designed to excite motion-selective cells with a particular speed tuning and a displacement component designed to excite cells with a sequence of spatial receptive fields. Pursuit eye movements were driven primarily by the local-motion component and were affected to only a small degree by the rate of target displacement across visual space. Extracellular single-unit recordings using the same stimuli revealed that the responses of cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) depended primarily on the local-motion component but were influenced by the displacement component to the same degree as were pursuit eye movements. We conclude that the initiation of pursuit is consistent with a reconstruction of target speed based on the speed tuning of the active population of MT cells.},

	Abstract = {Lu and Sperling {$[$}Vision Research. 35, 2697 (1995){$]$} proposed that human visual motion perception is served by three separate motion systems: a first-order system that responds to moving luminance patterns, a second-order system that responds to moving modulations of feature types-stimuli in which the expected luminance is the same everywhere but an area of higher contrast or of flicker moves, and a third-order system that computes the motion of marked locations in a "salience map," that is, a neural representation of visual space in which the locations of important visual features ("figure") are marked and "ground" is unmarked. Subsequently, there have been some strongly confirmatory reports: different gain-control mechanisms for first- and second-order motion, selective impairment of first- versus second- and/or third-order motion by different brain injuries, and the classification of new third-order motions, e.g., isoluminant chromatic motion. Various procedures have successfully discriminated between second- and third-order motion (when first-order motion is excluded): dual tasks, second-order reversed phi, motion competition, and selective adaptation. Meanwhile, eight apparent contradictions to the three-systems theory have been proposed. A review and reanalysis here of the new evidence, pro and con, resolves the challenges and yields a more clearly defined and significantly strengthened theory.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a depth-matching experiment in which subjects were asked to adjust the height of an ellipse until it matched the depth of a simulated cylinder defined by texture and motion cues. In one-third of the trials the shape of the cylinder was primarily given by motion information, in another one-third of the trials it was given by texture information, and on the remaining trials it was given by both sources of information. Two optimal cue combination models are described where optimality is defined in terms of Bayesian statistics. The parameter values of the models are set based on subjects' responses on trials when either the motion cue or the texture cue was informative. These models provide predictions of subjects' responses on trials when both cues were informative. The results indicate that one of the optimal models provides a good fit to the subjects' data, and the second model provides an exceptional fit. Because the predictions of the optimal models closely match the experimental data, we conclude that observers' cue-combination strategies are indeed optimal, at least under the conditions studied here.},

	Abstract = {When a person looks at an object while exploring it with their hand, vision and touch both provide information for estimating the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual-haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we first measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual-haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation.},

@article{Simani:2007xw,
	Abstract = {Visuomotor coordination requires both the accurate alignment of spatial information from different sensory streams and the ability to convert these sensory signals into accurate motor commands. Both of these processes are highly plastic, as illustrated by the rapid adaptation of goal-directed movements following exposure to shifted visual feedback. Although visual-shift adaptation is a widely used model of sensorimotor learning, the multifaceted adaptive response is typically poorly quantified. We present an approach to quantitatively characterizing both sensory and task-dependent components of adaptation. Sensory aftereffects are quantified with "alignment tests" that provide a localized, two-dimensional measure of sensory recalibration. These sensory effects obey a precise form of "additivity," in which the shift in sensory alignment between vision and the right hand is equal to the vector sum of the shifts between vision and the left hand and between the right and left hands. This additivity holds at the exposure location and at a second generalization location. These results support a component transformation model of sensory coordination, in which eye-hand and hand-hand alignment relies on a sequence of shared sensory transformations. We also ask how these sensory effects compare with the aftereffects measured in target reaching and tracking tasks. We find that the aftereffect depends on both the task performed during feedback-shift exposure and on the testing task. The results suggest the presence of both a general sensory recalibration and task-dependent sensorimotor effect. The task-dependent effect is observed in highly stereotyped reaching movements, but not in the more variable tracking task.},

As shown by a variety of psychophysical tests involving her perception of motion, the patient was impaired at motion discriminations that involved the detection of small displacements of random-dot displays, including local speed discrimination. However, she was unimpaired on tests that required spatial and temporal integration of moving displays, such as motion coherence. The results indicate that she had a specific impairment of the computation of local but not global motion and that she could not integrate motion information across different spatial scales. Such a specific impairment has not been reported before.},

Here we show that a patient with a small unilateral cortical lesion adjacent to human cortical area MT (V5) has an apparently permanent disorder in perceiving several forms of second-order but not first-order motion in his contralateral visual field. This result indicates that separate pathways for motion perception exist, either as divergent pathways from area MT or even from primary visual cortex, or as separate pathways from subcortical areas to extrastriate visual areas.},

	Abstract = {Three models of visual cue combination were simulated: a weak fusion model, a modified weak model, and a strong model. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are evaluated on the basis of their performances on the tasks of judging the depth and shape of an ellipse. The models differ in the amount of interaction that they permit among the cues of stereo, motion, and vergence angle. Results suggest that the constrained nonlinear interaction of the modified weak model allows better performance than either the linear interaction of the weak model or the unconstrained nonlinear interaction of the strong model. Further examination of the modified weak model revealed that its weighting of motion and stereo cues was dependent on the task, the viewing distance, and, to a lesser degree, the noise model. Although the dependencies were sensible from a computational viewpoint, they were sometimes inconsistent with psychophysical experimental data. In a second set of experiments, the modified weak model was given contradictory motion and stereo information. One cue was informative in the sense that it indicated an ellipse, while the other cue indicated a flat surface. The modified weak model rapidly reweighted its use of stereo and motion cues as a function of each cue's informativeness. Overall, the simulation results suggest that relative to the weak and strong models, the modified weak fusion model is a good candidate model of the combination of motion, stereo, and vergence angle cues, although the results also highlight areas in which this model needs modification or further elaboration.},

	Abstract = {When planning target-directed reaching movements, human subjects combine visual and proprioceptive feedback to form two estimates of the arm's position: one to plan the reach direction, and another to convert that direction into a motor command. These position estimates are based on the same sensory signals but rely on different combinations of visual and proprioceptive input, suggesting that the brain weights sensory inputs differently depending on the computation being performed. Here we show that the relative weighting of vision and proprioception depends both on the sensory modality of the target and on the information content of the visual feedback, and that these factors affect the two stages of planning independently. The observed diversity of weightings demonstrates the flexibility of sensory integration and suggests a unifying principle by which the brain chooses sensory inputs so as to minimize errors arising from the transformation of sensory signals between coordinate frames.},

	Abstract = {When monkeys make saccadic eye movements to simple visual targets, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) display a retinotopic, or eye-centered, coding of the target location. However natural saccadic eye movements are often directed at objects or parts of objects in the visual scene. In this paper we investigate whether LIP represents saccadic eye movements differently when the target is specified as part of a visually displayed object. Monkeys were trained to perform an object-based saccade task that required them to make saccades to previously cued parts of an abstract object after the object reappeared in a new orientation. We recorded single neurons in area LIP of two macaque monkeys and analyzed their activity in the object-based saccade task, as well as two control tasks: a standard memory saccade task and a fixation task with passive object viewing. The majority of LIP neurons that were tuned in the memory saccade task were also tuned in the object-based saccade task. Using a hierarchical generalized linear model analysis, we compared the effects of three different spatial variables on the firing rate: the retinotopic location of the target, the object-fixed location of the target, and the orientation of the object in space. There was no evidence of an explicit object-fixed representation in the activity in LIP during either of the object-based tasks. In other words, no cells had receptive fields that rotated with the object. While some cells showed a modulation of activity due to the location of the target on the object, these variations were small compared to the retinotopic effects. For most cells, firing rates were best accounted for by either the retinotopic direction of the movement, the orientation of the object, or both spatial variables. The preferred direction of these retinotopic and object orientation effects were found to be invariant across tasks. On average, the object orientation effects were consistent with the retinotopic coding of potential target locations on the object. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the magnitude of these two effects were roughly equal in the early portions of the trial, but around the time of the motor response, the retinotopic effects dominated. We conclude that LIP uses the same retinotopic coding of saccade target whether the target is specified as an absolute point in space or as a location on a moving object.},

	Abstract = {When planning goal-directed reaches, subjects must estimate the position of the arm by integrating visual and proprioceptive signals from the sensory periphery. These integrated position estimates are required at two stages of motor planning: first to determine the desired movement vector, and second to transform the movement vector into a joint-based motor command. We quantified the contributions of each sensory modality to the position estimate formed at each planning stage. Subjects made reaches in a virtual reality environment in which vision and proprioception were dissociated by shifting the location of visual feedback. The relative weighting of vision and proprioception at each stage was then determined using computational models of feedforward motor control. We found that the position estimate used for movement vector planning relies mostly on visual input, whereas the estimate used to compute the joint-based motor command relies more on proprioceptive signals.

	Abstract = {The sensorimotor calibration of visually guided reaching changes on a trial-to-trial basis in response to random shifts in the visual feedback of the hand. We show that a simple linear dynamical system is sufficient to model the dynamics of this adaptive process. In this model, an internal variable represents the current state of sensorimotor calibration. Changes in this state are driven by error feedback signals, which consist of the visually perceived reach error, the artificial shift in visual feedback, or both. Subjects correct for > or =20% of the error observed on each movement, despite being unaware of the visual shift. The state of adaptation is also driven by internal dynamics, consisting of a decay back to a baseline state and a "state noise" process. State noise includes any source of variability that directly affects the state of adaptation, such as variability in sensory feedback processing, the computations that drive learning, or the maintenance of the state. This noise is accumulated in the state across trials, creating temporal correlations in the sequence of reach errors. These correlations allow us to distinguish state noise from sensorimotor performance noise, which arises independently on each trial from random fluctuations in the sensorimotor pathway. We show that these two noise sources contribute comparably to the overall magnitude of movement variability. Finally, the dynamics of adaptation measured with random feedback shifts generalizes to the case of constant feedback shifts, allowing for a direct comparison of our results with more traditional blocked-exposure experiments.},

	Abstract = {We examined the ability of observers to determine the vertical alignment of three Gabor patches (cosine gratings tapered in X and Y by Gaussians) when the grating within the middle patch was moving right or left. The comparison patches were flickered in counterphase, as was the test patch in a control condition. In all conditions, the Gabor patch itself (the envelope) was stationary. Vernier acuity (i.e. sensitivity) was almost as good with the moving as with the flickering Gabors, but there was a very pronounced positional bias in the case of the patterns in which the internal gratings were moving. The (stationary) patches appeared to be displaced in the direction of the grating movement. Thus if the grating were drifting rightwards, the observer would see the patches as being aligned only when the test patch position in fact was shifted far over to the left. This movement-related bias increased rapidly with retinal eccentricity, reaching 15 min at 8 deg eccentricity. The bias was greatest at 4-8 Hz temporal frequency, and at low spatial frequencies. Whether the patterns were on the horizontal or the vertical meridian was largely irrelevant, but larger biases were found with patterns moving towards or away from the fovea than with those moving in a tangential direction.},

@article{Lisberger:1987bc,
	Abstract = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of our nervous system is to allow us to successfully interact with our environment. This normative idea is formalized by decision theory that defines which choices would be most beneficial. We live in an uncertain world, and each decision may have many possible outcomes; choosing the best decision is thus complicated. Bayesian decision theory formalizes these problems in the presence of uncertainty and often provides compact models that predict observed behavior. With its elegant formalization of the problems faced by the nervous system, it promises to become a major inspiration for studies in neuroscience. },

Fast and frugal heuristics meet the criteria set forth in Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2004. Fast and frugal heuristics are rules of thumb for decision making that are:

   1. ecologically rational (that is, they exploit structures of information in the environment)
   2. founded in evolved psychological capacities such as memory and the perceptual system
   3. fast, frugal, and simple enough to operate effectively when time, knowledge, and computational might are limited
   4. precise enough to be modeled computationally
   5. powerful enough to model both good and poor reasoning.

trast, many models of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, equipped with un- 
limited time, knowledge, and computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of satisficing, the 
authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: one- 
reason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical 
rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors 
held a competition between the satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm and various "rational" infer- 
ence procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed 
all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that cognitive 
mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical 
norms of rational inference.

complicated for ordinary minds to carry out. In contrast, the authors consider heuristics to be adaptive 
strategies that evolved in tandem with fundamental psychological mechanisms. The recognition heuristic, 
arguably the most frugal of all heuristics, makes inferences from patterns of missing knowledge. This 
heuristic exploits a fundamental adaptation of many organisms: the vast, sensitive, and reliable capacity 
for recognition. The authors specify the conditions under which the recognition heuristic is successful and 
when it leads to the counterintuitive less-is-more effect in which less knowledge is better than more for

@book{Pearl:2000bh,
	Abstract = {Why I Wrote this Book: Reflections and Expectations

I got my first hint of the dark world of causality during my junior year of high school.

My science teacher, Dr. Feuchtwanger, introduced us to the study of logic by discussing the 19th century finding that more people died from smallpox inoculations than from smallpox itself. Some people used this information to argue that inoculation was harmful when, in fact, the data proved the opposite, that inoculation was saving lives by eradicating smallpox.

"And here is where logic comes in," concluded Dr. Feuchtwanger, "To protect us from cause-effect fallacies of this sort." We were all enchanted by the marvels of logic, even though Dr. Feuchtwanger never actually showed us how logic protects us from such fallacies.

It doesn't, I realized years later as an artificial intelligence researcher. Neither logic, nor any branch of mathematics had developed adequate tools for managing problems, such as the smallpox inoculations, involving cause-effect relationships. Most of my colleagues even considered causal vocabulary to be dangerous, avoidable, ill-defined, and nonscientific. "Causality is endless controversy," one of them warned. The accepted style in scientific papers was to write "A implies B" even if one really meant "A causes B," or to state "A is related to B" if one was thinking "A affects B."

Clearly, such denial of causal thought could not last forever. The influence of artificial intelligence and the availability of powerful computer languages gave my generation the expectation that intuition should be expressed, not suppressed. And causality, it turns out, is not nearly as nasty as her reputation suggests. Once I got past a few mental blocks, I found causality to be smiling with clarity, bursting with new ideas and new possibilities. As the epilogue of my book summarizes:

             "Causality is not mystical or metaphysical.
             It can be understood in terms of simple processes,
             and it can be expressed in a friendly mathematical
             language, ready for computer analysis."

My intended audience includes: students of statistics who wonder why instructors are reluctant to discuss causality in class; students of epidemiology who wonder why simple concepts such as "confounding" are so terribly complex when expressed mathematically; students of economics and social science who often doubt the meaning of the parameters they estimate; and, naturally, students of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, who write programs and theories for knowledge discovery, causal explanations and causal speech.

I have aimed to provide each of these groups with separate ideas and techniques to make causal inference easier in their respective fields. The techniques will be a success only if they help resolve challenging problems in those fields, and I am fairly confident they will. },

@article{Bonhoeffer:1991sf,
	Abstract = {The mammalian cortex is organized in a columnar fashion: neurons lying below each other from the pia to the white matter usually share many functional properties. Across the cortical surface, cells with similar response properties are also clustered together, forming elongated bands or patches. Some response properties, such as orientation preference in the visual cortex, change gradually across the cortical surface forming 'orientation maps'. To determine the precise layout of iso-orientation domains, knowledge of responses not only to one but to many stimulus orientations is essential. Therefore, the exact depiction of orientation maps has been hampered by technical difficulties and remained controversial for almost thirty years. Here we use in vivo optical imaging based on intrinsic signals to gather information on the responses of a piece of cortex to gratings in many different orientations. This complete set of responses then provides detailed information on the structure of the orientation map in a large patch of cortex from area 18 of the cat. We find that cortical regions that respond best to one orientation form highly ordered patches rather than elongated bands. These iso-orientation patches are organized around 'orientation centres', producing pinwheel-like patterns in which the orientation preference of cells is changing continuously across the cortex. We have also analysed our data for fast changes in orientation preference and find that these 'fractures' are limited to the orientation centres. The pinwheels and orientation centres are such a prominent organizational feature that it should be important to understand their development as well as their function in the processing of visual information.},

	Abstract = {Individuals suffering from classical migraine report an astonishing diversity of migraine auras. A frequently reported symptom is a visual hallucination known as fortification illusion (FI). Here we demonstrate that the typical zig-zag pattern of the FI can be reproduced using experimental data of orientation maps of the primary visual cortex (V1) assuming that a continuous excitation front propagates across V1. We put forward a model in which the cortical neurons within this excitation wave are activated sufficiently to contribute to conscious perception. It is shown that the discontinuous repetitive nature of the zig-zag pattern of the FI can reflect the specific layout of visual cortical orientation maps. Additionally, dynamic features of the FI are predicted based on our model.},

enhancing human intelligence. For concreteness, we shall assume that 
the technology is genetic engineering (either somatic or germ line), 
although the argument we will present does not depend on the tech- 
nological implementation. For simplicity, we shall speak of enhanc- 
ing ``intelligence'' or ``cognitive capacity,'' but we do not presuppose 
that intelligence is best conceived of as a unitary attribute. Our con- 
siderations could be applied to specific cognitive abilities such as 
verbal fluency, memory, abstract reasoning, social intelligence, spa- 
tial cognition, numerical ability, or musical talent. It will emerge that 
the form of argument that we use can be applied much more gener- 
ally to help assess other kinds of enhancement technologies as well as 
other kinds of reform. However, to give a detailed illustration of how 
the argument form works, we will focus on the prospect of cognitive 
enhancement. },

	Abstract = {In the classic "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain," Lettvin and colleagues showed that different types of retinal ganglion cell send specific kinds of information. For example, one type responds best to a dark, convex form moving centripetally (a fly). Here we consider a complementary question: how much information does the retina send and how is it apportioned among different cell types? Recording from guinea pig retina on a multi-electrode array and presenting various types of motion in natural scenes, we measured information rates for seven types of ganglion cell. Mean rates varied across cell types (6-13 bits . s(-1)) more than across stimuli. Sluggish cells transmitted information at lower rates than brisk cells, but because of trade-offs between noise and temporal correlation, all types had the same coding efficiency. Calculating the proportions of each cell type from receptive field size and coverage factor, we conclude (assuming independence) that the approximately 10(5) ganglion cells transmit on the order of 875,000 bits . s(-1). Because sluggish cells are equally efficient but more numerous, they account for most of the information. With approximately 10(6) ganglion cells, the human retina would transmit data at roughly the rate of an Ethernet connection.},

	Abstract = {In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate 
cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit re- 
sponses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in 
influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the 
next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one 
may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual 
perception. 
By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) 
showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' 
centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a 
receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted 
to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole 
receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving light- 
adapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave 
little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, 
whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk 
responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger 
responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more 
activation for one direction than for the opposite. 
The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of 
receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells 
considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory 
('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell 
receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and 
inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal 
ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli 
with receptive field arrangements. Some cells could be activated from either 
eye, and in these binocular interaction was studied.

@article{Hubel:1968bc,
	Abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

	Abstract = {More than 30 years after Hubel and Wiesel first described orientation selectivity in the mammalian visual cortex, the mechanism that gives rise to this property is still controversial. Hubel and Wiesel proposed a simple model for the origin of orientation tuning, in which the circularly symmetrical receptive fields of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus that excite a cortical simple cell are arranged in rows. Since this model was proposed, several experiments and neuronal simulations have suggested that the connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is not well organized in an orientation-specific fashion, and that orientation tuning arises instead from extensive interactions within the cortex. To test these models we have recorded visually evoked synaptic potentials in simple cells while cooling the cortex, which largely inactivates the cortical network, but leaves geniculate synaptic input functional. We report that the orientation tuning of these potentials is almost unaffected by cooling the cortex, in agreement with Hubel and Wiesel's original proposal.},

	Abstract = {Cells in cat's area 17 respond optimally if elongated contrasts are presented at a certain angle or orientation with respect to the retina, or to the visual field, respectively (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). The preferred orientation and the range of orientation sensitivity of cells in close proximity to one another have been determined in order to investigate the spatial arrangement of the orientation domain in area 17. 1. A slight overrepresentation of vertical and horizontal orientations is seen in cells with complex receptive fields, whereas in cells with simple fields all orientations are represented to an equal degree. The orientation selectivity, defined as the halfwidth of tuning curves constructed from the cells response to a moving stimulus, is less than 60 degrees in more than 80% of all cells investigated, and is on the average 20-30 degrees smaller in cells with simple than in cells with complex receptive fields. 2. In 80% of all cases considered the difference in the preferred orientation between two cells less than 200 mum horizontally distant in area 17 is less than 30 degrees, which is of the order of an individual cells orientation selectivity. Each cell, therefore, will respond to some extent to that orientation which is preferred by the cells in the immediate surroundings. 3. Sequential changes in the preferred orientation between cells successively recorded are observed as the postlateral gyrus is explored from anterior to posterior and from medial to lateral. On these general trends a random variation in the preferred orientation between neighbouring cells of the order of 5-10 degrees is superimposed. One orientation sequence (180 degrees) occupies 700-1200 mum, so that on the average a change in the preferred orientation of the order of 10 degrees is complete after 50 mum distance in the cortex measured parallel to the pial surface. Assuming that 18 different orientations (+/- 5 degrees) functionally represent one complete orientation sequence it is found that 'all' orientations are functionally represented by the cells contained in a cortical cylinder of 300-700 mum in diameter. 4. Cells having the same preferred orientation are grouped together in cortical regions which appear in crossection as a band or a spot. These regions have been termed iso-orientation bands or spots. The diameter of the spots and the small diameter of the bands do not exceed 100 mum. Taking an average orientation selectivity of 40 degrees for cells vertically aligned in area 17 it is calculated that cells situated 100 mum to either side of an iso-orientation band or around an iso-orientation spot still respond with 50% of the discharge to their own optimal orientation ...},

	Abstract = {1. In the course of long oblique penetrations through the postlateral gyrus a variation in the position of the receptive fields (RF-scatter) of single cells recorded extracellularly is observed. This is superimposed on the continuous topological representation of the retina. Spezifying the RF-positions by the azimuthal and elevation coordinates of their geometrical centers, the standard deviation (SD) of the mean RF-positions of cells recorded in 200 mum long horizontal sections of cortex is calculated and the total radial scatter of RF-positions (Sanderson, 1971) as defined: (see article) is determined. The radial scatter is found to have its smallest value (1 degree visual angle (v.a.)) in the projection area of the functional center of the area centralis increasing to 3-4 degrees v.a. at 10 degrees eccentricity. 2. The mean RF-diameter as defined: (see article) is centrally 0.7 degrees v.a. increasing to 2.6 degrees v.a. at 10 degrees eccentricity. The ratio of the largest RF-diameter to the smallest RF-diameter is between 7-9 and remains almost constant over the central 10 degrees of the projection area. The magnification factor (M) as defined: mm Cortex/degree v.a. is centrally 2.3, decreasing paracentrally to 0.6. 3. The cells in area 17 whose RFs have the same direction in the visual field constitute the spatial subunit of the retinocortical projection. The diameter of the spatial subunit is calculated as: (see article). The spatial subunit functionally represents, therefore, that part of the visual field whose location and area is calculated by averaging over the RFs of the individuals of its cell population. It is found that the cells belonging to a spatial subunit are distributed within a cortical cylinder of 2.6-2.8 mm in diameter, the peak of the distribution coinciding with the central axis of the cylinder. 4. Within the projection area of the central 10 degrees of the retina in area 17 the spatial subunits have the same diameter. This suggests that each retinal ganglion cell is functionally connected with an equal number of cells in area 17 irrespective of its position within the retina and that, therefore, the retinocortical projection is organized on the basis of a stereotyped schema if a basic spatial relationship is concerned.},

@article{Tolhurst:1988zr,
	Abstract = {We review the evidence relating to the organization of the human striate cortex to determine whether the latter is organized in a way similar to that of the macaque monkey. There are only limited data available to allow direct determination of the magnification factors in human striate cortex. These suggest that the linear magnification factor is about 1.6 times greater than that in the macaque. This is consistent with the observations that the human striate cortex, compared to that of the macaque, has over 2 times the area, has neurones with longer dendrites, wider ocular dominance columns and more widely separated cytochrome oxidase "blobs". The striate cortices in both species have the same total number of neurones. The foveal magnification factor in the macaque is presently believed to be about 15 mm.deg-1; it seems reasonable, therefore, to believe that the human foveal value will be about 20-25 mm.deg-1 rather than the value of 8-11 mm.deg-1 which is currently accepted. Magnification factor falls more rapidly with eccentricity than do current estimates.},

@article{Tootell:1988ve,
	Abstract = {When macaque monkeys view achromatic, sinusoidal gratings of a single spatial frequency, the pattern of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by the gratings is shown to depend on the spatial frequency chosen. When a relatively high (5-7 cycles/deg) spatial frequency is shown binocularly at systematically varied orientations, uptake in parafoveal striate cortex is highest between the cytochrome oxidase blobs (that is, in the interblobs) in layers 1, 2, and 3. In layers 4B, 5, and 6, where the cytochrome oxidase blobs are faint or absent, DG uptake is highest in a periodic pattern that lies in register with the interblobs of layers 2 + 3. When the grating is, instead, of relatively low (1-1.5 cycles/deg) spatial frequency, DG uptake is highest in the blobs, in the blob-aligned portions of layers 1-4B, and in the lower-layer blobs as well. These variations in DG topography are confirmed in stimulus comparisons within a single hemisphere. Presumably, this shift in functional topography within the extra-granular layer is the primate homolog of "spatial frequency columns" shown earlier in the cat (Tootell et al., 1981; Silverman, 1984). In the well-differentiated architecture of primate striate cortex, laminar differences produced by high- versus low-spatial-frequency gratings are visible as well. Gratings of very high spatial frequency produce much higher uptake in 4Cb (which receives input from the parvocellular LGN layers) than in 4Ca (which gets its input from the magnocellular LGN layers). Gratings of low spatial frequency produce the converse result. Presumably, cells in the magnocellular LGN layers and/or in the magnocellular-dominated layer 4Ca have lower average spatial frequency tuning (larger receptive fields) than their counterparts in the parvocellular LGN and/or in striate layer 4Cb. The DG patterns produced by various spatial frequencies also vary with eccentricity, in a manner consistent with known, eccentricity-dependent variations of receptive-field size and spatial frequency tuning. Thus, gratings of a "middle"-spatial-frequency range (4-5 cycles/deg) produce high uptake in the blobs near the foveal representation and high uptake in the interblobs at more peripheral eccentricities, including 5 degrees. This shift in DG topography also includes the transition zone near 3 degrees, where the level of stimulus-driven uptake is as high in the blob regions as it is in interblob regions. Variations in uptake between layers 4Ca and 4Cb, as a function of eccentricity, shift in parallel with the changes in the upper-layer topography.},

	Abstract = {Macaque monkeys were shown achromatic gratings of various contrasts during 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) infusion in order to measure the contrast sensitivity of different subdivisions of primary visual cortex. DG uptake is essentially saturated at stimulus contrasts of 50% and above, although the saturation contrast varies with layer and with different criteria. Following visual stimulation with gratings of 8% contrast, stimulus-driven uptake was relatively high in striate layer 4Ca (which receives primary input from the magnocellular LGN layers), but was absent in layer 4Cb (which receives primary input from the parvocellular layers). In this same (magnocellular-specific) stimulation condition, striate layers 4B, 4Ca, and 6 showed strong stimulus-induced DG uptake, and layers 2, 3, 4A, and 5 showed only light or negligible uptake. By comparison to other cases that were shown stimuli of systematically higher contrast, and to a wide variety of DG cases shown very different stimuli, it is evident that information derived from the magnocellular and parvocellular layers in the LGN remains partially, or largely, segregated in its passage through striate cortex, and projects in a still somewhat segregated fashion to different extrastriate areas. The sum of all available evidence suggests that the magnocellular information projects strongly through striate layers 4Ca, 4B, and 6, with moderate input into the blobs in layers 2 + 3, and to blob-aligned portions of layer 4A. Parvocellular-dominated regions of striate cortex include both the blob and interblob portions of layers 2 + 3, 4A, 4Cb, and 5. Because the major striate input to V2 arrives from striate layers 2 + 3, and because the major striate input to MT originates in layer 4B and 6, it appears that area V2 receives information derived largely from the parvocellular LGN layers, and that area MT receives information derived mainly from the magnocellular layers.},

@article{Tootell:1988qf,
	Abstract = {Using spatially diffuse stimuli (or sinusoidal gratings of very low spatial frequency), levels of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by color-varying stimuli are much greater than those produced by luminance-varying stimuli in macaque striate cortex. Such a difference in DG results is consistent with previous psychophysical and electrophysiological results from man and monkey. In DG experiments with color-varying gratings of low and middle spatial frequencies, or with spatially diffuse color variations, DG uptake was highest in the cytochrome oxidase blobs, as was also seen with low-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. High-spatial-frequency, color-varying uptake patterns were shifted to cover both blob and interblob regions in a manner similar to that of the patterns obtained with middle-spatial-frequency luminance stimuli. However, in no instance did chromatic gratings produce uptake restricted to the interblob regions, as with the pattern seen with the highest-spatial-frequency luminance gratings. Thus, DG uptake is relatively higher in the interblob regions when comparing luminance with color-varying gratings that are otherwise similar. It was also possible to show DG evidence for receptive-field double-opponency in the upper-layer blobs, but color sensitivity in layer 4Cb appears single-opponent. The DG results suggest that color sensitivity is also high in the lower-layer (layers 5 + 6) blobs, and that many layer 5 receptive fields are double-opponent. Striate layers 4Ca and 4B-appeared color-insensitive in a wide variety of DG tests; this supports the idea of a color-insensitive stream running from the magnocellular LGN layers through striate layers 4Ca and 4B to extrastriate areas MT and V3. There was also a major effect due to wavelength: long and short wavelengths produced much more uptake than did middle wavelengths, even when all colors were equated for luminance and saturation. No variation with eccentricity was seen in cortical color sensitivity, at least between 0 degrees and 10 degrees.},

	Abstract = {Macaque monkeys were shown retinotopically-specific visual stimuli during 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) infusion in a study of the retinotopic organization of primary visual cortex (V1). In the central half of V1, the cortical magnification was found to be greater along the vertical than along the horizontal meridian, and overall magnification factors appeared to be scaled proportionate to brain size across different species. The cortical magnification factor (CMF) was found to reach a maximum of about 15 mm/deg at the representation of the fovea, at a point of acute curvature in the V1-V2 border. We find neither a duplication nor an overrepresentation of the vertical meridian. The magnification factor did not appear to be doubled in a direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance strips; it may not be increased at all. The DG borders in parvorecipient layer 4Cb were found to be as sharp as 140 micron (half-amplitude, half width), corresponding to a visual angle of less than 2' of arc at the eccentricity measured. In other layers (including magnorecipient layer 4Ca), the retinotopic borders are broader. The retinotopic spread of activity is greater when produced by a low-spatial-frequency grating than when produced by a high-spatial-frequency grating. Orientation-specific stimuli produced a pattern of activation that spread further than 1 mm across cortex in some layers. Some DG evidence suggests that the spread of functional activity is greater near the foveal representation than near 5 degrees eccentricity.},

@article{Tootell:1988bh,
	Abstract = {A series of experiments was carried out using 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) in order to examine the functional architecture of macaque striate (primary visual) cortex. This paper describes the results of experiments on uptake during various baseline (or reference) conditions of visual stimulation (described below), and on differences in the functional architecture following monocular versus binocular viewing conditions. In binocular "baseline" experiments, monkeys were stimulated either (1) in the dark, (2) with a diffuse gray screen, or (3) with a very general visual stimulus composed of gratings of varied orientation and spatial frequency. In all of these conditions, DG uptake was found to be topographically uniform within all layers of parafoveal striate cortex. In monocular experiments that were otherwise similar, uptake was topographically uniform within the full extent of the eye dominance strip, in all layers. Certain other visual stimuli produce high uptake in the blobs, and still another set of visual stimuli (including high-spatial-frequency gratings) produce highest uptake between the blobs at parafoveal eccentricities, even in an unanesthetized, unparalyzed monkey. Eye movements per se had no obvious effect on striate DG uptake. Endogenous uptake in the blobs (relative to that in the interblobs) appears higher in the squirrel monkey than in the macaque. The pattern of DG uptake produced by binocular viewing was found to deviate in a number of ways from that expected by linearly summing the component monocular DG patterns. One of the most interesting deviations was an enhancement of the representation of visual field borders between stimuli differing from each other in texture, orientation, direction, etc. This "border enhancement" was confined to striate layers 1-3 (not appearing in any of the striate input layers), and it only appeared following binocular, but not monocular, viewing conditions. The border enhancement may be related to a suppression of DG uptake that occurs during binocular viewing conditions in layers 2 + 3 (and perhaps layers 1 and 4B), but not in layers 4Ca, 4Cb, 5 or 6. Another major class of binocular interaction was a spread of neural activity into the "unstimulated" ocular dominance strips following monocular stimulation. Such an effect was prominent in striate layer 4Ca, but it did not occur in layer 4Cb. This "binocular" spread of DG uptake into the inappropriate eye dominance strip in 4Ca may be related to the appearance of orientation tuning and orientation columns in that layer. No DG effects were seen that depended on the absolute disparity of visual stimuli in macaque striate cortex.},

	Abstract = {1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3--3 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half-amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty-four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non-overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2--8 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17...},

	Abstract = {1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non-linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two-line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell-receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two-line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli...},

@article{Movshon:1978uo,
	Abstract = {1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light-evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one-dimensional luminance-modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non-linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non-linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non-linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on-off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves.},

	Abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

While an answer to the second question

biophysics, an answer to the first question 
is a description of computations performed 
on images. Important steps in providing this 
description were made with the publication 
of two classical studies on primary visual 
cortex by Movshon et al. (1978a,b). These 
studies have not aged in their readability, 
and do not require an interpretive key to 
be enjoyed by the contemporary reader. As 
an introduction, however, this Perspectives 
article briefly reviews the state of the art 
at the time of their appearance, their 
main findings, and their influence on three 
decades of subsequent investigations. },

	Abstract = {Perceptual events derive their significance to an animal from their meaning about the world, that is from the information they carry about their causes. The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes. By combining insights from the study of causal inference with the ideal-observer approach to sensory cue combination, we show that the capacity to infer causal structure is not limited to conscious, high-level cognition; it is also performed continually and effortlessly in perception.},

	Abstract = {The human brain processes different kinds of information (or cues) independently with different neural latencies. How does the brain deal with these differences in neural latency when it combines cues into one estimate? To find out, we introduced artificial asynchronies between the moments that monocular and binocular cues indicated that the slant of a surface had suddenly changed. Subjects had to detect changes in slant or to indicate their direction. We found that the cues were combined to improve performance even when the artificial asynchrony between them was about 100 ms. We conclude that neural latency differences of tens of milliseconds between cues are irrelevant because of the low temporal resolution of neural processing.},

@article{Lalanne:2004qc,
	Abstract = {The integration of information from different sensory modalities has many advantages for human observers, including increase of salience, resolution of perceptual ambiguities, and unified perception of objects and surroundings. Several behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging data collected in various tasks, including localization and detection of spatial events, crossmodal perception of object properties and scene analysis are reviewed here. All the results highlight the multiple faces of crossmodal interactions and provide converging evidence that the brain takes advantages of spatial and temporal coincidence between spatial events in the crossmodal binding of spatial features gathered through different modalities. Furthermore, the elaboration of a multimodal percept appears to be based on an adaptive combination of the contribution of each modality, according to the intrinsic reliability of sensory cue, which itself depends on the task at hand and the kind of perceptual cues involved in sensory processing. Computational models based on bayesian sensory estimation provide valuable explanations of the way perceptual system could perform such crossmodal integration. Recent anatomical evidence suggest that crossmodal interactions affect early stages of sensory processing, and could be mediated through a dynamic recurrent network involving backprojections from multimodal areas as well as lateral connections that can modulate the activity of primary sensory cortices, though future behavioral and neurophysiological studies should allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Our perception of the word is the result of combining information between several senses, such as vision, audition and proprioception. These sensory modalities use widely different frames of reference to represent the properties and locations of object. Moreover, multisensory cues come with different degrees of reliability, and the reliability of a given cue can change in different contexts. The Bayesian framework--which we describe in this review--provides an optimal solution to deal with this issue of combining cues that are not equally reliable. However, this approach does not address the issue of frames of references. We show that this problem can be solved by creating cross-modal spatial links in basis function networks. Finally, we show how the basis function approach can be combined with the Bayesian framework to yield networks that can perform optimal multisensory combination. On the basis of this theory, we argue that multisensory integration is a dialogue between sensory modalities rather that the convergence of all sensory information onto a supra-modal area.},

@article{Knill:2007hc,
	Abstract = {How the visual system learns the statistical regularities (e.g., symmetry) needed to interpret pictorial cues to depth is one of the outstanding questions in perceptual science. We test the hypothesis that the visual system can adapt its model of the statistics of planar figures for estimating three-dimensional surface orientation. In particular, we test whether subjects, when placed in an environment containing a large proportion of randomly shaped ellipses, learn to give less weight to a prior bias to interpret ellipses as slanted circles when making slant judgments of stereoscopically viewed ellipses. In a first experiment, subjects placed a cylinder onto a stereoscopically viewed, slanted, elliptical surface. In this experiment, subjects received full haptic feedback about the true orientation of the surface at the end of the movement. When test stimuli containing small conflicts between the circle interpretation as figure and the slant suggested by stereoscopic disparities were intermixed with stereoscopically viewed circles, subjects gave the same weight to the circle interpretation over the course of five daily sessions. When the same test stimuli were intermixed with stereoscopic views of randomly shaped ellipses, however, subjects gave progressively lower weights to the circle interpretation of test stimuli over five daily sessions. In a second experiment, subjects showed the same effect when they made perceptual judgments of slant without receiving feedback, showing that feedback is not required for learning. We describe a Bayesian model for combining multiple visual cues to adapt the priors underlying pictorial depth cues that qualitatively accounts for the observed behavior.},

Our dichoptic motion stimulus adds a new line of evidence, which supports the original conclusion of M. Shadlen and T. Carney (1986) that motion detection can be solely derived from early binocular motion processing. Further, we describe novel motion displays in which monocular motion and binocular motion are in opposite directions with variable intensity ratios. Our dichoptic stimuli will serve as a useful tool to investigate the interaction between low-level binocular motion detectors and monocular motion detectors without requiring feature extraction before motion detection.},

@article{Lisberger:1999hf,
	Abstract = {We asked whether the dynamics of target motion are represented in visual area MT and how information about image velocity and acceleration might be extracted from the population responses in area MT for use in motor control. The time course of MT neuron responses was recorded in anesthetized macaque monkeys during target motions that covered the range of dynamics normally seen during smooth pursuit eye movements. When the target motion provided steps of target speed, MT neurons showed a continuum from purely tonic responses to those with large transient pulses of firing at the onset of motion. Cells with large transient responses for steps of target speed also had larger responses for smooth accelerations than for decelerations through the same range of target speeds. Condition-test experiments with pairs of 64 msec pulses of target speed revealed response attenuation at short interpulse intervals in cells with large transient responses. For sinusoidal modulation of target speed, MT neuron responses were strongly modulated for frequencies up to, but not higher than, 8 Hz. The phase of the responses was consistent with a 90 msec time delay between target velocity and firing rate. We created a model that reproduced the dynamic responses of MT cells using divisive gain control, used the model to visualize the population response in MT to individual stimuli, and devised weighted-averaging computations to reconstruct target speed and acceleration from the population response. Target speed could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to its preferred speed. Target acceleration could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to the product of preferred speed and a measure of the size of its transient response.},

@article{Montagnini:2007er,
	Abstract = { The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limitation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended objects is initially dominated by the local 1D motion cues, related to the object's edges and orthogonal to them, whereas 2D information, related to terminators (or edge-endings), takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. A Bayesian framework accounting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for object velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [Weiss, Y., Adelson, E., 1998. Slow and smooth: a Bayesian theory for the combination of local motion signals in human vision. MIT Technical report, A.I. Memo 1624]. In particular, these models provide a qualitative account for the initial bias induced by the 1D motion cue. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of object motion perception, including the integration of different motion cues, is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving objects and more particularly the time course of its initiation phase, which reflects the ongoing motion integration process. In addition, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of 1D and 2D motion information. We compare the model predictions for object motion tracking with human oculomotor recordings.},

	Annote = {"It has been suggested that when the pursuit system is confronted with multiple objects, selective attention biases the observer to select a single one in a winner-take-all fashion (Kowler, 1990). Other work supports this contention for certain spatial and temporal target separations (Ferrera and Lisberger, 1997; Recanzone and Wurtz, 1999). Interestingly, during pursuit initiation, a weighted vector average of the speed and direction of both targets appears to describe the data better than does winner-take-all selection (Lisberger and Ferrera, 1997). Vector averaging during pursuit initiation occurs even when an animal is cued to track one of the targets before they move (Ferrera, 2000). In this study, the pre-motion cueing biased the subsequent pursuit response toward the cued target, yet the response remained influenced by the nonrewarded target motion. The results of microstimulation in area MT are consistent with the idea that velocity signals that are read out from this structure are vector averaged for use by the pursuit system (Groh et al., 1997)."

"A stimulus larger than a spot will activate a population of motion detectors that tiles a spatially extended region. Since the pursuit system can generate only a single eye velocity vector, the outputs of multiple motion detectors must be combined in this situation to produce one signal. The motion perception system integrates signals that stimulate multiple motion detectors to eliminate noise and to better detect and discriminate spatially extended stimuli (Watamaniuk and Sekuler, 1992)." (but this is not about temporla integration / global motion?)

"Other work has demonstrated that human observers can integrate the local motion of line-figure objects to derive a global motion signal (Beutter and Stone, 2000). Global information was used similarly to both perceive and pursue these objects, even when partial occlusion made the resulting image motion vastly different from the underlying object motion." (some kind of aperture/occlusion problem)},

	Abstract = { To clearly see a moving object, an observer must rotate his or her eyes with a velocity that matches that of the object. Such rotations are called smooth pursuit eye movements, and they depend critically on the ability of the primate brain to integrate information about object velocity from various local motion signals. When the local motion signals are in conflict, it is possible to use smooth pursuit eye movements as a continuous read-out of the motion integration process. This review discusses the results of recent behavioral experiments that have taken this approach, along with relevant neurophysiological and computational studies.},

	Abstract = { The combination of visual motion information over visual space (spatial summation) and stimulus duration (temporal integration) was investigated using a random-pixel arrayS (spatiotemporally broad-band) apparent motion stimulus designed to isolate specific populations of visual motion detectors. The results indicate that, in agreement with results from spatiotemporally narrow-band stimuli, spatial summation follows the form of linear probabilistic summation rather than non-linear probabilistic summation. Linear probabilistic summation holds for a wide range of stimulus parameters and when changing either motion stimulus height or width. Linear probabilistic summation breaks down when the motion display region approaches a height and/or width that is related to the spatial displacement size, not the speed, of the random-pixel array. This height and width (termed the critical height and width, or critical dimension), increases with spatial displacement size and can be interpreted as a measure of the basic dimensions of the selected motion detector population's receptive field. The critical height is smaller than the critical width, a result that is consistent with a motion detector receptive field that is elongated in the direction of motion. Perhaps most importantly, the mechanisms of temporal integration and spatial summation can work independently under a wide range of conditions. Finally, the results provide evidence for a short-term inhibitory phenomenon from the edges of the useful display area that affects the visibility of the motion.},

	Annote = {"If eccentricity is expressed as E, then MT cells' RF diameters average approximately 0.8E (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983a), about 10 times the diameter of a V1 cell of comparable eccentricity or 5 times that of a V2 cell. However, preferred spatial frequencies of MT cells do not scale with their larger RFs. These tend to peak near about 0.5 to 5 c/deg, not very different from their afferents, though they are somewhat more broadly tuned (J. A. Movshon, personal communication). This suggests that MT cells inherit their basic spatial tuning from their inputs."

"A large fraction (approximately half) of MT cells demonstrate spatial interactions on a much larger spatial scale: they possess antagonistic surrounds (Allman et al., 1985; Born, 2000; Raiguel et al., 1995). These surrounds are ``silent'' when stimulated alone but exert a profound modulatory effect on the response to stimulation in the RF center. The modulation is typically directional and maximally suppresses the response when motion is in the preferred direction. In the extreme, surround stimulation facilitates center responses when it is in the opposite direction. Such center-surround organization is optimal for the detection and discrimination of object motion when an object moves relative to the background. Cells that lack such antagonistic surrounds tend to respond optimally to wide-field motion, such as might be produced by self-motion through the environment. Interestingly, cells with and without antagonistic surrounds tend to be anatomically separated in columns or clusters (Born and Tootell, 1992)."

"However, it is difficult to get monkeys to honestly report their perception of genuinely ambiguous stimuli, because there is no objectively right or wrong answer upon which to base a reward. Fortunately, some reassurance comes from the pattern of eye movements made by monkeys. When faced with large moving displays, monkeys made small-amplitude tracking eye movements. When presented with plaids such as the ones used in the human psychophysical experiments, the monkeys' eye movements tended to correlate with human perception of the direction of motion (Dobkins et al., 1998). These experiments have been extended using other stimulus manipulations (color, surrounding context) which influence the perception of motion direction (see Chapter 82 in this volume; see also Duncan et al., 2000)."

	Abstract = { We report a new visual illusion, where a global shape appears to continually move away from fixation, even though it remains a fixed distance from fixation. The illusion occurs because local motion signals within the object indicate motion away from fixation, and are incorrectly attributed by the visual system to the motion trajectory of the global object. A simple weighted vector summation of global and local motion signals, while a reasonable first approximation, cannot fully account for our data. We show that the faster the local motion signal, the more it biases judgments of global motion direction. We propose that local and global motion signals are summed non-linearly for this stimulus because as local motion speed increases, moving luminance blobs are visible for less time, affording less time to inhibit inappropriate component motion signals. This effect reveals the degree to which the visual system can incorrectly combine local and global motion signals belonging to a single object.},

	Abstract = {Reliable motion perception requires processes that integrate visual motion signals from neighbouring locations in the visual field, which should have the effect of smoothing out spatial variations in velocity. However, we also require motion processing to be very sensitive to local velocity differences, so that moving objects appear sharply distinct from their background and specific differential properties of optic flow associated with the observer's motion can be detected. Perceptual experiments give evidence both for integrative processes, which lead to spreading of perceived motion, and for differential processes, which lead to motion contrast and segmentation. Current and future experiments might allow tests of theoretical schemes that employ adaptive networks and/or multiple representations in order to reconcile the conflicting demands of integration and segmentation.},

	Abstract = {Image motion is a primary source of visual information about the world. However, before this information can be used the visual system must determine the spatio-temporal displacements of the features in the dynamic retinal image, which originate from objects moving in space. This is known as the motion correspondence problem. We investigated whether cross-cue matching constraints contribute to the solution of this problem, which would be consistent with physiological reports that many directionally selective cells in the visual cortex also respond to additional visual cues. We measured the maximum displacement limit (Dmax) for two-frame apparent motion sequences. Dmax increases as the number of elements in such sequences decreases. However, in our displays the total number of elements was kept constant while the number of a subset of elements, defined by a difference in contrast polarity, binocular disparity or colour, was varied. Dmax increased as the number of elements distinguished by a particular cue was decreased. Dmax was affected by contrast polarity for all observers, but only some observers were influenced by binocular disparity and others by colour information. These results demonstrate that the human visual system exploits local, cross-cue matching constraints in the solution of the motion correspondence problem.},

	Abstract = {The position of a flash presented during pursuit is mislocalized in the direction of the pursuit. Although this has been explained by a temporal mismatch between the slow visual processing of flash and fast efferent signals on eye positions, here we show that spatial contexts also play an important role in determining the flash position. We put various continuously lit objects (walls) between veridical and to-be-mislocalized positions of flash. Consequently, these walls significantly reduced the mislocalization of flash, preventing the flash from being mislocalized beyond the wall (Experiment 1). When the wall was shortened or had a hole in its center, the shape of the mislocalized flash was vertically shortened as if cutoff or funneled by the wall (Experiment 2). The wall also induced color interactions; a red wall made a green flash appear yellowish if it was in the path of mislocalization (Experiment 3). Finally, those flash{\^a}wall interactions could be induced even when the walls were presented after the disappearance of flash (Experiment 4). These results indicate that various features (position, shape, and color) of flash during pursuit are determined with an integration window that is spatially and temporally broad, providing a new insight for generating mechanisms of eye-movement mislocalizations.},

@article{Vakrou:2007km,
	Abstract = {For the majority of visual tasks, performance in extrafoveal vision can be equated with that at the fovea simply by a change in spatial scale of the stimuli (magnification). We sought to exploit this association to examine the nature of second-order vision. More specifically, we investigate the relationship between the scale of second-order vision and the scale of its first-order input. We find that sensitivity to second-order stimuli can be equated across visual space, but only for stimuli that are magnified in every respect (identical scaling of both first- and second-order characteristics). In other words, sensitivity to stimuli which posses a fixed ratio between the scale of first-order input and second-order spatial scale can be equated across the visual field using a single magnification factor. Moreover, stimuli which possess quite different ratios of first- and second-order scale can be equated across eccentricity using the same magnification factor. This argues for a strict relationship between second-order vision and the scale of its first-order input and reflects a parallel arrangement of dedicated second-order mechanisms having a common eccentricity dependence.},

@article{Schlack:2007ht,
	Abstract = {Visual motion processing plays a key role in enabling primates' successful interaction with their dynamic environments. Although in natural environments the speed of visual stimuli continuously varies, speed tuning of neurons in the prototypical motion area MT has traditionally been assessed with stimuli that moved at constant speeds. We investigated whether the representation of speed in a continuously varying stimulus context differs from the representation of constant speeds. We recorded from individual MT neurons of fixating macaques while stimuli moved either at a constant speed or in a linearly accelerating or decelerating manner. We found clear speed tuning even when the stimulus consisted of visual motion with gradual speed changes. There were, however, important differences with the speed tuning as measured with constant stimuli: the stimulus context affected neuronal preferred speed as well as the associated tuning width of the speed tuning curves. These acceleration-dependent changes in response lead to an accurate representation of the acceleration of these stimuli in the MT cells. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of this signal, we constructed a stochastic firing rate model based on the constant speed response profiles. This model incorporated each cell's speed tuning and response adaptation dynamics and accurately predicted the response to constant speeds as well as accelerating and decelerating stimuli. Because the response of the model neurons had no explicit acceleration dependence, we conclude that speed-dependent adaptation creates a strong influence of temporal context on the MT response and thereby results in the representation of acceleration signals.},

@article{Knill:2007mq,
	Abstract = {Most research on depth cue integration has focused on stimulus regimes in which stimuli contain the small cue conflicts that one might expect to normally arise from sensory noise. In these regimes, linear models for cue integration provide a good approximation to system performance. This article focuses on situations in which large cue conflicts can naturally occur in stimuli. We describe a Bayesian model for nonlinear cue integration that makes rational inferences about scenes across the entire range of possible cue conflicts. The model derives from the simple intuition that multiple properties of scenes or causal factors give rise to the image information associated with most cues. To make perceptual inferences about one property of a scene, an ideal observer must necessarily take into account the possible contribution of these other factors to the information provided by a cue. In the context of classical depth cues, large cue conflicts most commonly arise when one or another cue is generated by an object or scene that violates the strongest form of constraint that makes the cue informative. For example, when binocularly viewing a slanted trapezoid, the slant interpretation of the figure derived by assuming that the figure is rectangular may conflict greatly with the slant suggested by stereoscopic disparities. An optimal Bayesian estimator incorporates the possibility that different constraints might apply to objects in the world and robustly integrates cues with large conflicts by effectively switching between different internal models of the prior constraints underlying one or both cues. We performed two experiments to test the predictions of the model when applied to estimating surface slant from binocular disparities and the compression cue (the aspect ratio of figures in an image). The apparent weight that subjects gave to the compression cue decreased smoothly as a function of the conflict between the cues but did not shrink to zero; that is, subjects did not fully veto the compression cue at large cue conflicts. A Bayesian model that assumes a mixed prior distribution of figure shapes in the world, with a large proportion being very regular and a smaller proportion having random shapes, provides a good quantitative fit for subjects' performance. The best fitting model parameters are consistent with the sensory noise to be expected in measurements of figure shape, further supporting the Bayesian model as an account of robust cue integration.},

	Abstract = {The cortical and subcortical connections of the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the macaque monkey were investigated using combined injections of [3H]proline and horseradish peroxidase within MT. Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei.},

@article{Churchland:2003xw,
	Abstract = {We recorded the smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys in response to targets that were extinguished (blinked) for 200 ms in mid-trajectory. Eye velocity declined considerably during the target blinks, even when the blinks were completely predictable in time and space. Eye velocity declined whether blinks were presented during steady-state pursuit of a constant-velocity target, during initiation of pursuit before target velocity was reached, or during eye accelerations induced by a change in target velocity. When a physical occluder covered the trajectory of the target during blinks, creating the impression that the target moved behind it, the decline in eye velocity was reduced or abolished. If the target was occluded once the eye had reached target velocity, pursuit was only slightly poorer than normal, uninterrupted pursuit. In contrast, if the target was occluded during the initiation of pursuit, while the eye was accelerating toward target velocity, pursuit during occlusion was very different from normal pursuit. Eye velocity remained relatively stable during target occlusion, showing much less acceleration than normal pursuit and much less of a decline than was produced by a target blink. Anticipatory or predictive eye acceleration was typically observed just prior to the reappearance of the target. Computer simulations show that these results are best understood by assuming that a mechanism of eye-velocity memory remains engaged during target occlusion but is disengaged during target blinks.},

@article{Churchland:2005zt,
	Abstract = {We recorded responses to apparent motion from directionally selective neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized monkeys and middle temporal area (MT) of awake monkeys. Apparent motion consisted of multiple stationary stimulus flashes presented in sequence, characterized by their temporal separation (delta t) and spatial separation (delta x). Stimuli were 8 degrees square patterns of 100% correlated random dots that moved at apparent speeds of 16 or 32 degrees/s. For both V1 and MT, the difference between the response to the preferred and null directions declined with increasing flash separation. For each neuron, we estimated the maximum flash separation for which directionally selective responses were observed. For the range of speeds we used, delta x provided a better description of the limitation on directional responses than did delta t. When comparing MT and V1 neurons of similar preferred speed, there was no difference in the maximum delta x between our samples from the two areas. In both V1 and MT, the great majority of neurons had maximal values of delta x in the 0.25-1 degrees range. Mean values were almost identical between the two areas. For most neurons, larger flash separations led to both weaker responses to the preferred direction and increased responses to the opposite direction. The former mechanism was slightly more dominant in MT and the latter slightly more dominant in V1. We conclude that V1 and MT neurons lose direction selectivity for similar values of delta x, supporting the hypothesis that basic direction selectivity in MT is inherited from V1, at least over the range of stimulus speeds represented by both areas.},

@article{Celebrini:1994qo,
	Abstract = {We recorded the responses of single neurons in extrastriate area MST while rhesus monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a set of stochastic visual displays. By varying systematically the strength of a coherent motion signal within the visual display, we were able to measure simultaneously the monkeys' psychophysical thresholds for direction discrimination and the responses of single neurons to the same motion signals. Neuronal thresholds for reliably signaling the direction of motion in the visual display were calculated from the measured responses using a method based in signal detection theory. Neurons in MST were exquisitely sensitive to motion signals in the display, having thresholds for discriminating the direction of coherent motion that were, on average, equal to the psychophysical thresholds of the monkeys. For many MST neurons, the intensity of the response was correlated with the monkey's psychophysical judgements for repeated presentations of a given near-threshold stimulus; the monkey tended to choose the preferred direction of the neuron under study when that neuron responded more strongly to the stimulus. In both of these respects, MST neurons were indistinguishable from neurons in extrastriate area MT, a major source of afferent input to MST. In a second set of experiments, we found that both of these results held true in the face of pronounced manipulations of the visual stimulus. Severe reductions in stimulus size and speed, for example, compromised neuronal and psychophysical sensitivities by similar amounts so that the average neuronal and psychophysical thresholds remained approximately equal. In addition, the trial-to-trial covariation of neuronal response and perceptual decision was unaffected by our stimulus manipulations. Thus, MST neurons carry signals appropriate for supporting psychophysical performance on our task over an impressively wide range of stimulus configurations.},

	Abstract = {We conducted electrophysiological recording and microstimulation experiments to test the hypothesis that the middle temporal visual area (MT) plays a direct role in perception of the speed of moving visual stimuli. We trained rhesus monkeys on a speed discrimination task in which monkeys chose the faster speed of two moving random dot patterns presented simultaneously in spatially segregated apertures. In electrophysiological experiments, we analyzed the activity of speed-tuned MT neurons and multiunit clusters during the discrimination task. Neural activity was correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices on a trial-to-trial basis (choice probability), and the correlation was predicted by the speed-tuning properties of each unit. In microstimulation experiments, we activated clusters of MT neurons with homogeneous speed-tuning properties during the same speed discrimination task. In one monkey, microstimulation biased speed judgments toward the preferred speed of the stimulated neurons. Together, evidence from these two experiments suggests that MT neurons play a direct role in the perception of visual speed. Comparison of psychometric and neurometric thresholds revealed that single and multineuronal signals were, on average, considerably less sensitive than were the monkeys perceptually, suggesting that signals must be pooled across neurons to account for performance.},

	Abstract = {Microelectrode recording and 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) labeling were used to investigate center-surround interactions in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the owl monkey. These techniques revealed columnar groups of neurons whose receptive fields had opposite types of center-surround interaction with respect to moving visual stimuli. In one type of column, neurons responded well to objects such as a single bar or spot but poorly to large textured stimuli such as random dots. This was often due to the fact that the receptive fields had antagonistic surrounds: surround motion in the same direction as that preferred by the center suppressed responses, thus rendering these neurons unresponsive to wide-field motion. In the second set of complementary, interdigitated columns, neuronal receptive fields had reinforcing surrounds and responded optimally to wide-field motion. This functional organization could not be accounted for by systematic differences in binocular disparity. Within both column types, neurons whose receptive fields exhibited center-surround interactions were found less frequently in the input layers compared with the other layers. Additional tests were done on single units to examine the nature of the center-surround interactions. The direction tuning of the surround was broader than that of the center, and the preferred direction, with respect to that of the center, tended to be either in the same or opposite direction and only rarely in orthogonal directions. Surround motion at various velocities modulated the overall responsiveness to centrally placed moving stimuli, but it did not produce shifts in the peaks of the center's tuning curves for either direction or speed. In layers 3B and 5 of the local motion processing columns, a number of neurons responded only to local motion contrast but did so over a region of the visual field that was much larger than the optimal stimulus size. The central feature of this receptive field type was the generalization of surround antagonism over retinotopic space-a property similar to other "complex" receptive fields described previously. The columnar organization of different types of center-surround interactions may reflect the initial segregation of visual motion information into wide-field and local motion contrast systems that serve complementary functions in visual motion processing. Such segregation appears to occur at later stages of the macaque motion processing stream, in the medial superior temporal area (MST), and has also been described in invertebrate visual systems where it appears to be involved in the important function of distinguishing background motion from object motion.},

	Abstract = {The small visual area known as MT or V5 has played a major role in our understanding of the primate cerebral cortex. This area has been historically important in the concept of cortical processing streams and the idea that different visual areas constitute highly specialized representations of visual information. MT has also proven to be a fertile culture dish--full of direction- and disparity-selective neurons--exploited by many labs to study the neural circuits underlying computations of motion and depth and to examine the relationship between neural activity and perception. Here we attempt a synthetic overview of the rich literature on MT with the goal of answering the question, What does MT do?},

	Abstract = {Summary Due to fixational eye movements, the image on the retina is always in motion, even when one views a stationary scene. When an object moves within the scene, the corresponding patch of retina experiences a different motion trajectory than the surrounding region. Certain retinal ganglion cells respond selectively to this condition, when the motion in the cell's receptive field center is different from that in the surround. Here we show that this response is strongest at the very onset of differential motion, followed by gradual adaptation with a time course of several seconds. Different subregions of a ganglion cell's receptive field can adapt independently. The circuitry responsible for differential motion adaptation lies in the inner retina. Several candidate mechanisms were tested, and the adaptation most likely results from synaptic depression at the synapse from bipolar to ganglion cell. Similar circuit mechanisms may act more generally to emphasize novel features of a visual stimulus.},

	Abstract = {We examined target selection for visually-guided reaching in monkeys using a visual search task in which an odd-colored target was presented with distractors. The colors of the target and distractors were randomly switched in each trial between red and green, and the number of distractors was varied. Previous studies of saccades and attention have shown that target selection in this task is easier when a greater number of homogenous distractors is present. We found that monkeys made fewer reaches to distractors and that reaches to the target were completed more quickly when a greater number of homogenous distractors was present. When the target was presented in a sparse array of distractors, reaches had longer movement durations and greater trajectory curvature. Reaching errors were directed more often to a distractor adjacent to the target, suggesting a spatially coarse-to-fine progression during target selection. Reaches were also influenced by the properties of trials in the recent past. When the colors of the target and distractors remained the same from trial to trial rather than switching, reaches were completed more quickly and accurately, indicating that color priming across trials facilitates target selection. Moreover, when difficult search trials were randomly intermixed with easier trials without distractors, reach latencies were influenced by the difficulty of previous trials, indicating that motor initiation strategies are gradually adjusted based on accumulated experience. Overall, these results are consistent with reaching results in humans, indicating that the monkey provides a sound model for understanding the neural underpinnings of reach target selection.},

	Abstract = {Most of our visual experience is driven by the eye movements we produce while we fixate our gaze. In a sense, our visual system thus has a built-in contradiction: when we direct our gaze at an object of interest, our eyes are never still. Therefore the perception, physiology, and computational modeling of fixational eye movements is critical to our understanding of vision in general, and also to the understanding of the Neural Computationations that work to overcome neural adaptation in normal subjects as well as in clinical patients. Moreover, because we are not aware of our fixational eye movements, they can also help us understand the underpinnings of visual awareness. Research in the field of fixational eye movements faded in importance for several decades during the late 20th century. However, new electrophysiological and psychophysical data have now rejuvenated the field. The last decade has brought significant advances to our understanding of the neuronal and perceptual effects of fixational eye movements, with crucial implications for neural coding, visual awareness, and perception in normal and pathological vision. This chapter will review the type of neural activity generated by fixational eye movements at different levels in the visual system, as well as the importance of fixational eye movements for visual perception in normal vision and in visual disease. Special attention will be given to microsaccades, the fastest and largest type of fixational eye movement.},

	Abstract = {Small eye movements are necessary for maintained visibility of the static scene, but at the same time they randomly oscillate the retinal image, so the visual system must compensate for such motions to yield the stable visual world. According to the theory of visual stabilization based on retinal motion signals, objects are perceived to move only if their retinal images make spatially differential motions with respect to some baseline movement probably due to eye movements. Motion illusions favoring this theory are demonstrated, and psychophysical as well as brain-imaging studies on the illusions are reviewed. It is argued that perceptual stability is established through interactions between motion-energy detection at an early stage and spatial differentiation of motion at a later stage. As such, image oscillations originating in fixational eye movements go unnoticed perceptually, and it is also shown that image oscillations are, though unnoticed, working as a limiting factor of motion detection. Finally, the functional importance of non-differential, global motion signals are discussed in relation to visual stability during large-scale eye movements as well as heading estimation.},

@article{Soto-Faraco:2006yq,
	Abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the influence of multisensory integration mechanisms in the processing of motion information. One central issue in this research area concerns the extent to which the behavioral correlates of these effects can be attributed to late post-perceptual (i.e., response-related or decisional) processes rather than to perceptual mechanisms of multisensory binding. We investigated the influence of various top-down factors on the phenomenon of crossmodal dynamic capture, whereby the direction of motion in one sensory modality (audition) is strongly influenced by motion presented in another sensory modality (vision). In Experiment 1, we introduced extensive feedback in order to manipulate the motivation level of participants and the extent of their practice with the task. In Experiment 2, we reduced the variability of the irrelevant (visual) distractor stimulus by making its direction predictable beforehand. In Experiment 3, we investigated the effects of changing the stimulus-response mapping (task). None of these manipulations exerted any noticeable influence on the overall pattern of crossmodal dynamic capture that was observed. We therefore conclude that the integration of multisensory motion cues is robust to a number of top-down influences, thereby revealing that the crossmodal dynamic capture effect reflects the relatively automatic integration of multisensory motion information.},

	Abstract = {An unresolved issue in visual motion perception is how distinct are the processes underlying 'first-order' and 'second-order' motion. The former is defined by spatio-temporal variations of luminance and the latter by spatio-temporal variations in other image attributes such as contrast or depth, for example. Using neuroimaging and psychophysics we present data from four neurological patients with unilateral and mostly cortical infarcts, which strongly suggest that first- and second-order motion have a different neural substrate. We found that from the early stages of processing, these two types of motions are mediated by two distinct pathways: first-order motion is carried out by mechanisms along the dorsal pathway in the occipital lobe, while the second-order motion by mechanisms mostly along the ventral pathway. The data reported here also suggest that different cortical regions may be in charge of processing direction-discrimination in second-order motion defined by different second-order attributes.},

	Abstract = {Studying the transfer of visuomotor adaptation from a given effector (e.g., the eye) to another (e.g., the hand) allows us to question whether sensorimotor processes influenced by adaptation are common to both effector control systems and thus to address the level where adaptation takes place. Previous studies have shown only very weak transfer of the amplitude adaptation of reactive saccades--i.e., produced automatically in response to the sudden appearance of visual targets--to hand pointing movements. Here we compared the amplitude of hand pointing movements recorded before and after adaptation of either reactive or voluntary saccades, produced either in a saccade sequence task or in a single saccade task. No transfer to hand pointing movements was found after adaptation of reactive saccades. In contrast, a substantial transfer to the hand was obtained following adaptation of voluntary saccades produced in sequence. Large amounts of transfer between the two saccade types were also found. These results demonstrate that the visuomotor processes influenced by saccadic adaptation depend on the type of saccades and that, in the case of voluntary saccades, they are shared by hand pointing movements. Implications for the neurophysiological substrates of the adaptation of reactive and voluntary saccades are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Rats rhythmically sweep their whiskers over object features, generating sequential deflections of whisker arcs. Such moving wavefronts of whisker deflection are likely to be fundamental elements of natural somatosensory input. To determine how moving wavefronts are represented in somatosensory cortex (S1), we measured single- and multiunit neural responses in S1 of anesthetized rats to moving wavefronts applied through a piezoelectric whisker deflector array. Wavefronts consisted of sequential deflections of individual whisker arcs, which moved progressively across the whisker array. Starting position (starting arc), direction, and velocity of wavefronts were varied. Neurons responded strongly only when wavefront starting position included their principal whisker (PW). When wavefronts started at neighboring positions and swept through the PW, responses to the PW arc were suppressed by {$[$}\&le;{$]$}95{\%}, and responses over the entire wavefront duration were suppressed by {$[$}\&le;{$]$}60{\%} compared with wavefronts that initiated with the PW. Suppression occurred with interarc deflection delays of {$[$}\&ge;{$]$}5 ms, was maximal at 20 ms, and recovered within 100200 ms. Suppression of PW arc responses during wavefronts was largely independent of wavefront direction. However, layer 2/3 neurons showed direction selectivity for responses to the entire wavefront (the entire sequence of SW and PW arc deflection). Wavefront direction selectivity was correlated with receptive field somatotopy and reflected differential responses to the specific SWs that were deflected first in a wavefront. These results indicate that suppressive interwhisker interactions shape responses to wavefronts, resulting in increased salience of wavefront starting position, and, in some neurons, preference for wavefront direction. },

The responses of neurons in cor tical areas V2 and V4 can be signif-

	Abstract = {Step-ramp target motion evokes a characteristic sequence of presaccadic smooth eye movement in the direction of the target ramp, catch-up targets to bring eye position close to the position of the moving target, and postsaccadic eye velocities that nearly match target velocity. I have analyzed this sequence of eye movements in monkeys to reveal a strong postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit eye velocity and to document the conditions that lead to that enhancement. Smooth eye velocity was measured in the last 10 ms before and the first 10 ms after the first saccade evoked by step-ramp target motion. Plots of eye velocity as a function of time after the onset of the target ramp revealed that eye velocity at a given time was much higher if measured after versus before the saccade. Postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit was recorded consistently when the target stepped 3 degrees eccentric on the horizontal axis and moved upward, downward, or away from the position of fixation. To determine whether postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit was invoked by smear of the visual scene during a saccade, I recorded the effect of simulated saccades on the presaccadic eye velocity for step-ramp target motion. The 3 degrees simulated saccade, which consisted of motion of a textured background at 150 degrees/s for 20 ms, failed to cause any enhancement of presaccadic eye velocity. By using a strategically selected set of oblique target steps with horizontal ramp target motion, I found clear enhancement for saccades in all directions, even those that were orthogonal to target motion. When the size of the target step was varied by up to 15 degrees along the horizontal meridian, postsaccadic eye velocity did not depend strongly either on the initial target position or on whether the target moved toward or away from the position of fixation. In contrast, earlier studies and data in this paper show that presaccadic eye velocity is much stronger when the target is close to the center of the visual field and when the target moves toward versus away from the position of fixation. I suggest that postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit reflects activation, by saccades, of a switch that regulates the strength of transmission through the visual-motor pathways for pursuit. Targets can cause strong visual motion signals but still evoke low presaccadic eye velocities if they are ineffective at activating the pursuit system.},

	Abstract = {Saccades modulate the relationship between visual motion and smooth eye movement. Before a saccade, pursuit eye movements reflect a vector average of motion across the visual field. After a saccade, pursuit primarily reflects the motion of the target closest to the endpoint of the saccade. We tested the hypothesis that the saccade produces a spatial weighting of motion around the endpoint of the saccade. Using a moving pursuit stimulus that stepped to a new spatial location just before a targeting saccade, we controlled the distance between the endpoint of the saccade and the position of the moving target. We demonstrate that the smooth eye velocity following the targeting saccade weights the presaccadic visual motion inputs by the distance from their location in space to the endpoint of the saccade, defining the extent of a spatiotemporal filter for driving the eyes. The center of the filter is located at the endpoint of the saccade in space, not at the position of the fovea. The filter is stable in the face of a distracter target, is present for saccades to stationary and moving targets, and affects both the speed and direction of the postsaccadic eye movement. The spatial filter can explain the target-selecting gain change in postsaccadic pursuit, and has intriguing parallels to the process by which perceptual decisions about a restricted region of space are enhanced by attention. The effect of the spatial saccade plan on the pursuit response to a given retinal motion describes the dynamics of a coordinate transformation.},

	Abstract = {Monkeys fixated a stationary spot during presentation of dot textures that moved in apparent motion defined by the spatial and temporal separations, Deltax and Deltat, between successive flashes of each dot. For each neuron, we assessed the speed tuning for smooth motion (Deltat = 2 or 4 ms) at speeds < or =128 degrees /s and the effect of varying the value of Deltat at speeds of 16 and 32 degrees /s. Many medial superior temporal (MST) neurons, like middle temporal (MT) neurons, were tuned for the speed of smooth motion and showed decreases in firing rate as the value of Deltat increased at a constant speed. A subset of MST neurons, however, showed monotonically increasing firing rates as a function of smooth stimulus speed and responses to apparent motion that paralleled a previously discovered illusion where estimates of target speed increase with the value of Deltat. Opponent firing rate, defined as the difference between responses for motion in the preferred and opposite directions, peaked at values of Deltat that were consistent with the behavioral illusion. Comparison with a new sample of MT neurons recorded with the same stimuli failed to reveal comparable effects. Attempts to map the population responses in MT and MST onto the behavioral illusion of increased speed succeeded by averaging the opponent response across MST neurons, but only by applying vector averaging to determine the preferred speed of the most active MT neurons. We suggest that a vector-averaging computation transforms MT's place code for target speed into the rate code of some MST neurons.},

@article{Garbutt:2006fk,
	Abstract = {Perceptual attention and target choice for movement have many features in common. In particular, both generally are based on selection of a particular location in space. To ask whether motor control, like attention, also can exhibit target choice based on nonspatial features of the stimulus, we assessed the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements when two targets move in different directions after human subjects have been cued which direction or color to track. The direction cue consisted of a patch of dots undergoing either 0% coherent motion or 50% coherent motion in the direction of motion of one of the subsequent targets. After a delay, the fixation spot was extinguished and two spots moved across the same small region of the visual field, one in the cued direction ("target") and one in an orthogonal direction ("distracter"). After the 0% coherent cue, pursuit was approximately the vector average of responses to the two motions presented singly. After the 50% coherent cue, the initial pursuit response was biased strongly toward the target that moved in the cued direction. The impact of the cued direction persisted over delays of up to 1000 ms. Other cues about the direction of upcoming target motion biased the response similarly. Cues about target color also biased pursuit in the direction of motion of the cued target but were considerably less effective than cues indicating the direction of target motion. We conclude that target choice for movement, like perceptual attention, can be based on the features of the chosen target and not only its location in space.},

@article{Osborne:2007lr,
	Abstract = {To evaluate the nature and possible sources of variation in sensory-motor behavior, we measured the signal-to-noise ratio for the initiation of smooth-pursuit eye movements as a function of time and computed thresholds that indicate how well the pursuit system discriminates small differences in the direction, speed, or time of onset of target motion. Thresholds improved rapidly as a function of time and came close to their minima during the interval when smooth eye movement is driven only by visual motion inputs. Many features of the data argued that motor output and sensory discrimination are limited by the same noise source. Pursuit thresholds reached magnitudes similar to those for perception: <2-3 degrees of direction, approximately 11-15% of target speed, and 8 ms of change in the time of onset of target motion. Pursuit and perceptual thresholds had similar dependencies on the duration of the motion stimulus and showed similar effects of target speed. The evolution of information about direction of target motion followed the same time course in pursuit behavior and in a previously reported sample of neuronal responses from extrastriate area MT. Changing the form of the sensory input while keeping the motor response fixed had significant effects on the signal-to-noise ratio in pursuit for direction discrimination, whereas holding the sensory input constant while changing the combination of muscles used for the motor output did not. We conclude that noise in sensory processing of visual motion provides the major source of variation in the initiation of pursuit.},

@article{Beers:2007lr,
	Abstract = {Our movements are variable, but the origin of this variability is poorly understood. We examined the sources of variability in human saccadic eye movements. In two experiments, we measured the spatiotemporal variability in saccade trajectories as a function of movement direction and amplitude. One of our new observations is that the variability in movement direction is smaller for purely horizontal and vertical saccades than for saccades in oblique directions. We also found that saccade amplitude, duration, and peak velocity are all correlated with one another. To determine the origin of the observed variability, we estimated the noise in motor commands from the observed spatiotemporal variability, while taking into account the variability resulting from uncertainty in localization of the target. This analysis revealed that uncertainty in target localization is the major source of variability in saccade endpoints, whereas noise in the magnitude of the motor commands explains a slightly smaller fraction. In addition, there is temporal variability such that saccades with a longer than average duration have a smaller than average peak velocity. This noise model has a large generality because it correctly predicts the variability in other data sets, which contain saccades starting from very different initial locations. Because the temporal noise most likely originates in movement planning, and the motor command noise in movement execution, we conclude that uncertainty in sensory signals and noise in movement planning and execution all contribute to the variability in saccade trajectories. These results are important for understanding how the brain controls movement.},

	Abstract = {Miniature eye movements occur involuntarily during visual fixation. The most prominent contribution to these fixational eye movements is generated by microsaccades, which are rapid small-amplitude saccades with a rate of about one per second. Recent work demonstrates that microsaccades are optimized to counteract perceptual fading during perception of a stationary scene. Furthermore, microsaccades are modulated by visual attention and turned out to generate rich spatio-temporal dynamics. We conclude that the investigation of microsaccades will evolve into a new research field contributing to many facets of oculomotor control, visual perception, and the allocation of attention.},

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.},

The spatially localized target and masks enabled investigation of space dependent lateral interactions between foveal and neighboring spatial channels. Our data show a suppressive region extending to a radius of two wavelengths, in which the presence of the masking signals have the effect of increasing target threshold. Beyond this range a much larger facilitatory region (up to a distance of ten wavelengths) is indicated, in which contrast thresholds were found to decrease by up to a factor of two. The interactions between the foveal target and the flanking Gabor signals are spatial-frequency and orientation specific in both regions, but less specific in the suppression region.},

	Abstract = {Smooth-pursuit eye velocity to a moving target is more accurate after an initial catch-up saccade than before, an enhancement that is poorly understood. We present an individual-differences-based method for identifying mechanisms underlying a physiological response and use it to test whether visual motion signals driving pursuit differ pre- and postsaccade. Correlating moment-to-moment measurements of pursuit over time with two psychophysical measures of speed estimation during fixation, we find two independent associations across individuals. Presaccadic pursuit acceleration is predicted by the precision of low-level (motion-energy-based) speed estimation, and postsaccadic pursuit precision is predicted by the precision of high-level (position-tracking) speed estimation. These results provide evidence that a low-level motion signal influences presaccadic acceleration and an independent high-level motion signal influences postsaccadic precision, thus presenting a plausible mechanism for postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit.},

	Abstract = {Single neurons can signal subtle changes in the sensory environment with surprising fidelity, often matching the perceptual sensitivity of trained psychophysical observers. This similarity poses an intriguing puzzle: why is psychophysical sensitivity not greater than that of single neurons? Pooling responses across neurons should average out noise in the activity of single cells, leading to substantially improved psychophysical performance. If, however, noise is correlated among these neurons, the beneficial effects of pooling would be diminished. To assess correlation within a pool, the responses of pairs of neurons were recorded simultaneously during repeated stimulus presentations. We report here that the observed covariation in spike count was relatively weak, the correlation coefficient averaging 0.12. A theoretical analysis revealed, however, that weak correlation can limit substantially the signalling capacity of the pool. In addition, theory suggests a relationship between neuronal responses and psychophysical decisions which may prove useful for identifying cell populations underlying specific perceptual capacities.},

@article{Huang:2007uq,
	Abstract = {Visual motion perception relies on two opposing operations: integration and segmentation. Integration overcomes motion ambiguity in the visual image by spatial pooling of motion signals, whereas segmentation identifies differences between adjacent moving objects. For visual motion area MT, previous investigations have reported that stimuli in the receptive field surround, which do not elicit a response when presented alone, can nevertheless modulate responses to stimuli in the receptive field center. The directional tuning of this "surround modulation" has been found to be mainly antagonistic and hence consistent with segmentation. Here, we report that surround modulation in area MT can be either antagonistic or integrative depending upon the visual stimulus. Both types of modulation were delayed relative to response onset. Our results suggest that the dominance of antagonistic modulation in previous MT studies was due to stimulus choice and that segmentation and integration are achieved, in part, via adaptive surround modulation.},

	Abstract = {To guide behavior, perceptual and motor systems must estimate properties of the sensory environment from the responses of populations of cortical neurons. In the domain of visual motion, estimates of target speed are derived from the responses of motion-sensitive neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of the extrastriate visual cortex and are used to drive smooth pursuit eye movements and perceptual judgments of speed. We have asked how these behavioral systems estimate target speed from the population response in area MT. We found that increasing the spatial frequency of a sine wave grating caused decreases in the target speed estimated by both pursuit and perception and commensurate changes in the identity of the active neurons in area MT. Decreasing the contrast of a sine wave grating caused decreases in the target speed estimated by both pursuit and perception, while altering only the response amplitude of MT neurons and not the identity of the active neurons. Applying a modified vector-averaging computation to the population response measured in area MT allowed us to predict the effects of both spatial frequency and contrast on speed estimation for both perception and pursuit. The modification biased the speed estimation toward low target speeds when responses across the population of neurons were small.},

	Abstract = {Human speed discrimination thresholds follow Weber's law over a large range of reference (i.e., pedestal) speeds, that is, the just-noticeable-difference in speed scales in proportion to the reference speed. We analyzed the neural representation of speed information in macaque middle temporal visual area (MT) to determine whether this representation can account for the basic form of psychophysical data. Based on theoretical considerations, we hypothesized: (1) that the speed tuning curves of MT neurons should be bell-shaped (Gaussian) as a function of the logarithm of speed, (2) that the set of speed-tuning curves should be approximately scale-invariant, (3) that the distribution of speed preferences should be approximately uniform in log speed, and (4) that response variability should be independent of speed preference. Our quantitative analysis of data from 501 MT neurons shows that the neural representation of speed approximately obeys these constraints, with modest deviations particularly at slow speeds. We then used the MT data to predict how speed discrimination thresholds should depend on pedestal speed. The shape of this prediction matches very closely to that of human psychophysical data, accounting for constant Weber fractions over a large range of intermediate speeds as well as a marked departure from Weber's law at slow speeds. Moreover, we show that deviations of the MT representation from the above constraints are important for predicting how psychophysical thresholds depart from Weber's law at slow speeds. These findings support the notion that a logarithmic, approximately scale-invariant representation of speed in area MT limits perceptual speed discrimination.},

	Abstract = {The contributions of the middle superior temporal area (MST) in the posterior parietal cortex of rhesus monkeys to the generation of smooth-pursuit eye movements as well as the contributions to motion perception are well established. Here, we present the first experimental evidence that this area also contributes to the generation of goal-directed hand movements toward a moving target. This evidence is based on the outcome of intracortical microstimulation experiments and transient lesions by small injections of muscimol at identified sites within the lateral part of area MST (MST-l). When microstimulation was applied during the execution of smooth-pursuit eye movements, postsaccadic eye velocity in the direction of the preferred direction of the stimulated site increased significantly (in 93 of 136 sites tested). When microstimulation was applied during a hand movement trial, the hand movement was displaced significantly in the same direction (in 28 of 39 sites tested). When we lesioned area MST-l transiently by injections of muscimol, steady-state eye velocity was exclusively reduced for ipsiversive smooth-pursuit eye movements. In contrast, hand movements were displaced toward the contralateral side, irrespective of the direction of the moving target. Our results provide evidence that area MST-l is involved in the processing of moving targets and plays a role in the execution of smooth-pursuit eye movements as well as visually guided hand movements.},

@article{Krauzlis:2004pd,
	Abstract = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

@article{Kettner:2002qf,
	Abstract = {The role of flocculus and paraflocculus neurons in the cerebellar control of predictive eye movements was examined using two modeling techniques. The first study characterized the dependence of individual Purkinje-cell firing patterns on oculomotor output, visual input, and response timing using multilinear regression techniques. Interestingly, no dependence on visual input was detected. Purkinje cell firing was explained by sensitivities to eye position and eye velocity alone. However, complex responses occurred when sensitivity vectors pointed in different directions. For example, some neurons showed a preference for circular pursuit in a particular rotation direction. Responses also tended to lead the eye during predictable pursuit and to lag during unpredictable, visually driven pursuit. This suggests that flocculus and paraflocculus neurons played a stronger role during predictive pursuit than visually driven pursuit. A second modeling study demonstrated how the flocculus/paraflocculus system might generate predictive pursuit. A biologically realistic neural network was simulated based on the known anatomy and physiology of this cerebellar system. It included mossy and climbing fibers with realistic responses, Purkinje cells acting on well-characterized brain-stem circuits, and granule, Golgi, basket, and stellate cells with appropriate connections. The network was able to learn new pursuit trajectories based on long-term alterations in synaptic connectivity at parallel-to-Purkinje synapses. Interestingly, this model was able to generate predictive pursuit without visual input based only on eye-motion input. Thus, both models provide complementary evidence for the generation of nonvisual predictive control by flocculus and paraflocculus neurons.},

	Abstract = {Primates can generate accurate, smooth eye-movement responses to moving target objects of arbitrary shape and size, even in the presence of complex backgrounds and/or the extraneous motion of non-target objects. Most previous studies of pursuit have simply used a spot moving over a featureless background as the target and have thus neglected critical issues associated with the general problem of recovering object motion. Visual psychophysicists and theoreticians have shown that, for arbitrary objects with multiple features at multiple orientations, object-motion estimation for perception is a complex, multi-staged, time-consuming process. To examine the temporal evolution of the motion signal driving pursuit, we recorded the tracking eye movements of human observers to moving line-figure diamonds. We found that pursuit is initially biased in the direction of the vector average of the motions of the diamond's line segments and gradually converges to the true object-motion direction with a time constant of approximately 90 ms. Furthermore, transient blanking of the target during steady-state pursuit induces a decrease in tracking speed, which, unlike pursuit initiation, is subsequently corrected without an initial direction bias. These results are inconsistent with current models in which pursuit is driven by retinal-slip error correction. They demonstrate that pursuit models must be revised to include a more complete visual afferent pathway, which computes, and to some extent latches on to, an accurate estimate of object direction over the first hundred milliseconds or so of motion.},

	Abstract = {When a person tracks a small moving object, the visual images in the background of the visual scene move across his/her retina. It, however, is possible to estimate the actual motion of the images despite the eye-movement-induced motion. To understand the neural mechanism that reconstructs a stable visual world independent of eye movements, we explored areas MT (middle temporal) and MST (medial superior temporal) in the monkey cortex, both of which are known to be essential for visual motion analysis. We recorded the responses of neurons to a moving textured image that appeared briefly on the screen while the monkeys were performing smooth pursuit or stationary fixation tasks. Although neurons in both areas exhibited significant responses to the motion of the textured image with directional selectivity, the responses of MST neurons were mostly correlated with the motion of the image on the screen independent of pursuit eye movement, whereas the responses of MT neurons were mostly correlated with the motion of the image on the retina. Thus these MST neurons were more likely than MT neurons to distinguish between external and self-induced motion. The results are consistent with the idea that MST neurons code for visual motion in the external world while compensating for the counter-rotation of retinal images due to pursuit eye movements.},

@article{Eifuku:1998gf,
	Abstract = {The medial superior temporal area of the macaque monkey extrastriate visual cortex can be divided into a dorsal medial (MSTd) and a lateral ventral (MSTl) region. The functions of the two regions may not be identical: MSTd may process optic flow information that results from the movement of the observer, whereas MSTl may be related more closely to processing visual motion related specifically to the motion of objects. If MSTl were related to such object motion, one would expect to see mechanisms for the segregation of objects from their surround. We investigated one of these mechanisms in MSTl neurons: the effect of stimuli falling in the region surrounding the receptive field center on the response to stimuli falling in the field center. We found the effects of the surround stimulation to be modulatory with little response to the surround stimulus itself but a clear effect on the response to the stimulus falling on the receptive field center. The response to motion in the center in the direction preferred for the neuron usually increased when the surround motion was in the opposite direction to that in the center and decreased when surround motion was in the same direction as that in the center. Fifty-seven percent of the neurons showed a ratio of response for center motion with a surround moving in the opposite direction to that in the center for center motion alone that was >1. The response to motion in the center also increased when the surround stimulus was stationary, and this increase was sometimes larger than that with a moving surround. Nearly 70% of the neurons showed a ratio of response to center motion with a stationary surround to center motion alone that was >1. This is in contrast to the minimal effect of stationary surrounds in middle temporal area neurons. When the stimulus presentation was reversed so that the stimulus in the center was stationary and the surround moved, some MSTl neurons responded when the direction of motion in the surround was in the direction opposite to the preferred direction of motion in the center of the receptive field. Stimulation of the surround thus had a profound effect on the response of MSTl neurons, and this pronounced effect of the surround is consistent with a role in the segmentation of objects using motion.},

	Abstract = {1. Pursuit eye movements are usually made against a visual background that is moved across the retina by the pursuit movement. We have investigated the effect of this visual stimulation on the response of pursuit cells that lie within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the monkey. 2. We assigned these pursuit cells to one of two groups depending on the nature of their preferred visual stimulus. One group of cells, comprising all cells located in the dorsal-medial region of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and some cells in lateral-anterior MST (MST1), responded to the motion of a large patterned field but showed little or no response to small spots or slits. The other group, consisting of all foveal middle temporal area (MTf) cells and many MST1 cells, responded preferentially to small spot motion or equally well to small spot motion or large field. 3. For many pursuit cells that preferred large-field stimuli, the visual response showed a reversal of the preferred direction of motion as the size of the stimulus field increased. The reversal usually occurred as the size of the moving random-dot field used as a stimulus increased in size from 20 x 20 degrees to 30 x 30 degrees for motion at approximately 10 degrees/s. The size of the filed stimulus leading to reversal of preferred direction depended on the speed of stimulus motion. Higher speeds of motion required larger stimulus fields to produce a reversal of preferred direction. This reversal (of preferred direction) did not reflect a center-surround organization of the receptive field but seemed to reflect the spatial summation properties of these cells. 4. For three-quarters of the cells that preferred large-field stimulation, the preferred direction of motion for the large field was opposite to the preferred direction of the pursuit response. The remaining cells showed either the same preferred directions for large-field visual stimulation and the pursuit response or had bidirectional visual responses. If we consider only the cells that show a reversal of preferred direction for large- and small-field stimuli, the preferred direction for the large field was always the opposite to that of pursuit, and the preferred direction for the small field was always the same. 5. During pursuit against a lighted background, the cells that showed opposite preferred directions for large-field stimulation and pursuit had synergistic responses--a facilitation of the pursuit response over the response during pursuit in the dark. Slow pursuit speeds (less than 20 degrees/s) produced the greatest facilitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

@article{Newsome:1988zr,
	Abstract = {1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of MT (MTf), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of MST (MSTd), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of MST (MST1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in MTf, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in MSTd, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. MST cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {1. Among the multiple extrastriate visual areas in monkey cerebral cortex, several areas within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are selectively related to visual motion processing. In this series of experiments we have attempted to relate this visual motion processing at a neuronal level to a behavior that is dependent on such processing, the generation of smooth-pursuit eye movements. 2. We studied two visual areas within the STS, the middle temporal area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST). For the purposes of this study, MT and MST were defined functionally as those areas within the STS having a high proportion of directionally selective neurons. MST was distinguished from MT by using the established relationship of receptive-field size to eccentricity, with MST having larger receptive fields than MT. 3. A subset of these visually responsive cells within the STS were identified as pursuit cells--those cells that discharge during smooth pursuit of a small target in an otherwise dark room. Pursuit cells were found only in localized regions--in the foveal region of MT (MTf), in a dorsal-medial area of MST on the anterior bank of the STS (MSTd), and in a lateral-anterior area of MST on the floor and the posterior bank of the STS (MST1). 4. Pursuit cells showed two characteristics in common when their visual properties were studied while the monkey was fixating. Almost all cells showed direction selectivity for moving stimuli and included the fovea within their receptive fields. 5. The visual response of pursuit cells in the several areas differed in two ways. Cells in MTf preferred small moving spots of light, whereas cells in MSTd preferred large moving stimuli, such as a pattern of random dots. Cells in MTf had small receptive fields; those in MSTd usually had large receptive fields. Visual responses of pursuit neurons in MST1 were heterogeneous; some resembled those in MTf, whereas others were similar to those in MSTd. This suggests that the pursuit cells in MSTd and MST1 belong to different subregions of MST.},

	Abstract = {A flash of light evokes neural activity in the brain with a delay of 30-100 milliseconds, much of which is due to the slow process of visual transduction in photoreceptors. A moving object can cover a considerable distance in this time, and should therefore be seen noticeably behind its actual location. As this conflicts with everyday experience, it has been suggested that the visual cortex uses the delayed visual data from the eye to extrapolate the trajectory of a moving object, so that it is perceived at its actual location. Here we report that such anticipation of moving stimuli begins in the retina. A moving bar elicits a moving wave of spiking activity in the population of retinal ganglion cells. Rather than lagging behind the visual image, the population activity travels near the leading edge of the moving bar. This response is observed over a wide range of speeds and apparently compensates for the visual response latency. We show how this anticipation follows from known mechanisms of retinal processing.},

@article{Smith:2006fk,
	Abstract = {The response of a neuron in primary visual cortex (V1) to an optimal stimulus in its classical receptive field (CRF) can be reduced by the presence of an orthogonal mask, a phenomenon known as cross-orientation suppression. The presence of a parallel stimulus outside the CRF can have a similar effect, in this case known as surround suppression. We used a novel stimulus to probe the time course of cross-orientation suppression and found that it is very fast, starting even before the response to optimal excitatory stimuli. However, it occurs with some delay after the offset response, considered to be a measure of the earliest excitatory signals that reach the CRF. We also examined the time course of response to a stimulus presented outside the CRF and found that cross-orientation suppression begins substantially earlier than surround suppression measured in the same cells. Together, these findings suggest that cross-orientation suppression is attributable to either direct feedforward signal paths to V1 neurons or a circuit involving fast local interneurons within V1. Feedback from higher cortical areas is implicated in surround suppression, but our results make this an implausible mechanism for cross-orientation suppression. We conclude that suppression from inside and outside the CRF occur through different mechanisms.},

This includes the distinction and hierarchy between simple and complex cells, the mechanisms underlying the receptive field surround, and debates about optimal stimuli for mapping receptive fields. An important new problem arises from recent observations of stimulus-dependent spatial and temporal summation in primary visual cortex. It appears that the receptive field can no longer be considered unique, and we might have to relinquish this cherished notion as the embodiment of neuronal function in primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the extrastriate motion area MT/V5 constitute a critical channel that links early cortical mechanisms of spatiotemporal integration to downstream signals that underlie motion perception. We studied how temporal integration in direction-selective cells depends on speed, spatial frequency (SF), and contrast using randomly moving sinusoidal gratings and spike-triggered average (STA) analysis. The window of temporal integration revealed by the STAs varied substantially with stimulus parameters, extending farther back in time for slow motion, high SF, and low contrast. At low speeds and high SF, STA peaks were larger, indicating that a single spike often conveyed more information about the stimulus under conditions in which the mean firing rate was very low. The observed trends were similar in V1 and MT and offer a physiological correlate for a large body of psychophysical data on temporal integration. We applied the same visual stimuli to a model of motion detection based on oriented linear filters (a motion energy model) that incorporated an integrate-and-fire mechanism and found that it did not account for the neuronal data. Our results show that cortical motion processing in V1 and in MT is highly nonlinear and stimulus dependent. They cast considerable doubt on the ability of simple oriented filter models to account for the output of direction-selective neurons in a general manner. Finally, they suggest that spike rate tuning functions may miss important aspects of the neural coding of motion for stimulus conditions that evoke low firing rates.},

@article{Bair:2003fj,
	Abstract = {Iso-orientation surround suppression is a powerful form of visual contextual modulation in which a stimulus of the preferred orientation of a neuron placed outside the classical receptive field (CRF) of the neuron suppresses the response to stimuli within the CRF. This suppression is most often attributed to orientation-tuned signals that propagate laterally across the cortex, activating local inhibition. By studying the temporal properties of surround suppression, we have uncovered characteristics that challenge standard notions of surround suppression. We found that the latency of suppression depended on its strength. Across cells, strong suppression arrived on average 30 msec earlier than weak suppression, and suppression sometimes arrived faster than the excitatory CRF response. We compared the relative latency of CRF response onset and offset with the relative latency of suppression onset and offset. Response onset was delayed relative to response offset in the CRF but not in the surround. This is not the expected result if neurons targeted by suppression are like those that generate it. We examined the time course of suppression as a function of distance of the surround stimulus from the CRF and found that suppression was predominantly sustained for nearby stimuli and predominantly transient for distant stimuli. By comparing the latency of suppression for nearby and distant stimuli, we found that orientation-tuned suppression could effectively propagate across 6 - 8 mm of cortex at approximately 1 m/sec. This is considerably faster than expected for horizontal cortical connections previously implicated in surround suppression. We offer refinements to circuits for surround suppression that account for these results and describe how feedback from cells with large CRFs can account for the rapid propagation of suppression within V1.},

@article{Cavanaugh:2002kx,
	Abstract = {The responsiveness of neurons in V1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals from the surround have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences from the surround by studying the interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that the surround influence was always suppressive when the surround grating was at the neuron's preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when the surround grating also moved in the neuron's preferred direction, rather than its opposite. When the orientation in the surround was 90 degrees from the preferred orientation (orthogonal), suppression was weaker, and facilitation was sometimes evident. The tuning of surround signals therefore tended to match the tuning of the center, though the tuning of the surround was somewhat broader. The tuning of suppression also depended on the contrast of the center grating-when the center grating was reduced in contrast, orthogonal surround stimuli became relatively more suppressive. We also found evidence for the tuning of the surround being dependent to some degree on the stimulus used in the center-suppression was often stronger for a given center stimulus when the parameters of the surround grating matched the parameters of the center grating even when the center grating was not itself of the optimal direction or orientation. We also explored the spatial distribution of surround influence and found an orderly relationship between the orientation of grating patches presented to regions of the surround and the position of greatest suppression. When surround gratings were oriented parallel to the preferred orientation of the receptive field, suppression was strongest at the receptive field ends. When surround gratings were orthogonal, suppression was strongest on the flanks. We conclude that the surround has complex effects on responses from the classical receptive field. We suggest that the underlying mechanism of this complexity may involve interactions between relatively simple center and surround mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

	Abstract = {Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

	Abstract = {The role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in the visual guidance of movements was studied in monkeys trained to use a joystick to guide a spot to a target. Visual and motor influences were dissociated by transiently occluding the spot and by varying the relationship between the direction of joystick and spot movements. We found a strong segregation of function in PPC during visual guidance. Neurons in area MST were selectively modulated by the direction of visible moving stimuli, whereas neurons in area MIP were selectively modulated by the direction of hand movement. In contrast, the selectivity of cells in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) did not directly depend on either visual input or motor output, but rather seemed to encode a predictive representation of stimulus movement. These predictive signals may be an important link in visuomotor transformations.},

@article{Eskandar:2002qy,
	Abstract = {We examined neuronal signals in the monkey medial superior temporal area (MST), the medial intraparietal area (MIP), and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) during visually guided hand movements. Two animals were trained to use a joystick to guide a spot to a target. Many neurons responded in a direction-selective manner in this guidance task. We tested whether the direction selectivity depended on the direction of the stimulus spot or the direction of the hand movement. First, in some trials, the moving spot disappeared transiently. Second, the mapping between the hand direction and the spot direction was reversed on alternate blocks of trials. Third, we recorded the spot's movement while the animals moved the joystick and then played back that movement while the animals fixated without moving the joystick. Neurons in the three parietal areas conveyed distinct directional information. MST neurons were active and directional only on visible trials in both joystick-movement mode and playback mode and were not affected by the direction of hand movement. MIP neurons were mainly directional with respect to the hand movement, although some MIP neurons were also selective for stimulus direction. MIP neurons were much less active in playback mode. LIP neurons were active and directional in both joystick-movement mode and playback mode. Directional signals in LIP were unrelated to planning saccades. The selectivity of LIP neurons also became evident hundreds of milliseconds before the start of movement. Since the direction of movement was consistent throughout a block of trials, these signals could provide a prediction of the upcoming direction of motion. We tested this by alternating blocks of trials in which the direction was consistent or randomized. The direction selectivity developed earlier on trials in which the upcoming direction could be predicted. These results suggest that LIP neurons combine "bottom-up" visual motion signals with extraretinal, predictive signals about stimulus motion.},

	Abstract = {We recorded from parietal neurons in monkeys (Macacca mulatta) trained to report the direction of an apparent motion stimulus consisting of regularly spaced columns of dots surrounded by an aperture. Displacing the dots by half their inter-column spacing produced vivid apparent motion that could be perceived in either the preferred or anti-preferred direction for each neuron. Many neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) responded more strongly on trials in which the animals reported perceiving the neurons' preferred direction, independent of the hand movement used to report their percept. This selectivity was less common in the medial superior temporal area (MST) and virtually absent in the middle temporal area (MT). Variations in activity of LIP and MST neurons just before motion onset were also predictive of the animals' subsequent perceived direction. These data suggest a hierarchy of representation in parietal cortex, whereby neuronal responses become more aligned with subjective perception in higher parietal areas.},

@article{Merchant:2004fj,
	Abstract = {We recorded the neuronal activity in the arm area of the motor cortex and parietal area 7a of two monkeys during interception of stimuli moving in real and apparent motion. The stimulus moved along a circular path with one of five speeds (180-540 degrees/s), and was intercepted at 6 o'clock by exerting a force pulse on a semi-isometric joystick which controlled a cursor on the screen. The real stimuli were shown in adjacent positions every 16 ms, whereas in the apparent motion situation five stimuli were flashed successively at the vertices of a regular pentagon. The results showed, first, that a group of neurons in both areas above responded not only during the interception but also during a NOGO task in which the same stimuli were presented in the absence of a motor response. This finding suggests these areas are involved in both the processing of the stimulus as well as in the preparation and production of the interception movement. In addition, a group of motor cortical cells responded during the interception task but not during a center --> out task, in which the monkeys produced similar force pulses towards eight stationary targets. This group of cells may be engaged in sensorimotor transformations more specific to the interception of real and apparent moving stimuli. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that the time-varying neuronal activity in area 7a and motor cortex was related to various aspects of stimulus motion and hand force in both the real and apparent motion conditions, with stimulus-related activity prevailing in area 7a and hand-related activity prevailing in motor cortex. In addition, the neural activity was selectively associated with the stimulus angle during real motion, whereas it was tightly correlated to the time-to-contact in the apparent motion condition, particularly in the motor cortex. Overall, these observations indicate that neurons in motor cortex and area 7a are processing different parameters of the stimulus depending on the kind of stimulus motion, and that this information is used in a predictive fashion in motor cortex to trigger the interception movement.},

	Abstract = {FOR many types of behaviours, it is necessary to monitor the position or movement of objects that are temporarily occluded. The primate posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are active during visual guidance tasks: in some cases, even if the visual target disappears transiently1,2. It has been proposed that activity of this sort could be related to current or planned eye movements1,2, but it might also provide a more generalized abstract representation of the spatial disposition of targets, even when they are not visible. We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary. The activity was thus present in the absence of either sensory input or motor output, suggesting that it may indeed constitute a generalized representation of target motion.},
	Annote = {10.1038/373518a0

This gives either POSTDICTIVE or INFERRED motion -- on occlusion trials, the stimulus DID NOT MOVE before it was occluded, rather its motion was inferred from being in a block where hte stimuli were occluded and consistently moved.

Carries an interesting reference to Newsome, Wurtz, and Komatsu 1988 (dorsal MST having response to moving spots; response maintains when spot is extinguished or stabilized.)},

	Abstract = {A recent challenge to the completeness of some influential models of local-motion detection has come from experiments in which subjects had to detect a single dot moving along a trajectory amidst noise dots undergoing Brownian motion. We propose and test a new theory of the detection and measurement of visual motion, which can account for these signal-in-Brownian-noise experiments. The theory postulates that the signals from local-motion detectors are made coherent in space and time by a special purpose network, and that this coherence boosts signals of features moving along non-random trajectories over time. Two experiments were performed to estimate parameters and test the theory. These experiments showed that detection is impaired with increasing eccentricity, an effect that varies inversely with step size. They also showed that detection improves over durations extending to at least 600 msec. An implementation of the theory accounts for these psychophysical detection measurements.},

	Abstract = {Previous work has shown that a single dot moving in a consistent direction is easily detected among noise dots in Brownian motion (Watamaniuk et al., Vis Res 1995;35:65-77). In this study we calculated the predictions of a commonly-used psychophysical motion model for a motion trajectory in noise. This model assumes local motion energy detectors optimally tuned to the signal, followed by a decision stage that implements the maximum rule. We first show that local motion detectors do indeed explain the detectability of brief trajectories (100 ms) that fall within a single unit, but that they severely underestimate the detectability of extended trajectories that span multiple units. For instance, a 200 ms trajectory is approximately three times more detectable than two isolated 100 ms trajectories presented together within an equivalent temporal interval. This result suggests a nonlinear interaction among local motion units. This interaction is not restricted to linear trajectories because circular trajectories with curvatures larger than 1 degree are almost as detectable as linear trajectories. Our data are consistent with a flexible network that feeds forward excitation among units tuned to similar directions of motion.},

	Abstract = {We develop a theory for the temporal integration of visual motion motivated by psychophysical experiments. The theory proposes that input data are temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of the data association techniques that engineers use to study motion sequences. Our temporal grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory, we derive a parallel network that shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers. In deriving our theory, we assumed spatial factorizability of the probability distributions and made the approximation of updating the marginal distributions of velocity at each point. This allowed us to perform local computations and simplified our implementation. We argue that these approximations are suitable for the stimuli we are considering (for which spatial coherence effects are negligible).},

	Abstract = {Human observers can easily detect a signal dot moving, in apparent motion, on a trajectory embedded in a background of random-direction motion noise. A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate for detecting the signal dot was as high as 90% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a "string" of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250-400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.},

	Abstract = {The visual system has no difficulty maintaining the identity of an object as it disappears and reappears behind stationary occluders. In the natural world, a moving object may differ from occluders by many characteristics (colour, depth, shape and so on). Scene segmentation based on these characteristics is thought to happen early in visual processing, and to influence how objects, including moving objects, are identified. What happens if the only characteristic distinguishing an object is its direction of motion? Experiments with random dot displays show that one dot moving in a constant trajectory is readily detected among identical dots in brownian motion. Detection declines sharply if the trajectory is intermittently broken, but improves if occluders obscure the breaks in the trajectory. It is not sufficient that these occluders be perceived as segmented from the rest of the display (such as by colour or depth). Rather, it is critical that the occluders do not contain motion that is similar in direction to that of the target trajectory. We conclude that detection of the trajectory is due to the integration of information within a network of low-level motion detectors and is not dependent on segmentation processes.},

	Abstract = {Moving objects occupy a range of positions during the period of integration of the visual system. Nevertheless, a unique position is usually observed. We investigate how the trajectory of a stimulus influences the position at which the object is seen. It has been shown before that moving objects are perceived ahead of static objects shown at the same place and time. We show here that this perceived position difference builds up over the first 500 ms of a visible trajectory. Discontinuities in the visual input reduce this buildup when the presentation frequency of a stimulus with a duration of 42 ms falls below 16 Hz. We interpret this relative mislocalization in terms of a spatiotemporal-filtering model. This model fits well with the data, given two assumptions. First, the position signal persists even though the objects are no longer visible and, second, the perceived distance is a 500 ms average of the difference of these position signals.},

	Abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence over time and then select the appropriate action. We present here a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts in cortex, it is possible to optimally implement evidence accumulation through linear integration, and action selection through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and when the reliability of the sensory evidence varies over time. Our model can account for the speed-accuracy trade-off reported in humans, as well as the response of cells in lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) and the superior colliculus (SC). Furthermore, it predicts that the LIP neurons involved in the evidence accumulation encode, at all times, a probability distribution that reflects the confidence of the animal. We present experimental evidence in support of this specific prediction, and discuss other predictions for the general case.},

	Abstract = {When a flash is aligned with a moving object, subjects perceive the flash to lag behind the moving object. Two different models have been proposed to explain this "flash-lag" effect. In the motion extrapolation model, the visual system extrapolates the location of the moving object to counteract neural propagation delays, whereas in the latency difference model, it is hypothesized that moving objects are processed and perceived more quickly than flashed objects. However, recent psychophysical experiments suggest that neither of these interpretations is feasible (Eagleman & Sejnowski, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c), hypothesizing instead that the visual system uses data from the future of an event before committing to an interpretation. We formalize this idea in terms of the statistical framework of optimal smoothing and show that a model based on smoothing accounts for the shape of psychometric curves from a flash-lag experiment involving random reversals of motion direction. The smoothing model demonstrates how the visual system may enhance perceptual accuracy by relying not only on data from the past but also on data collected from the immediate future of an event.},

	Abstract = {Possible physiological mechanisms to explain the flash-lag effect, in which subjects perceive a flashed item that is co-localized with a moving item as trailing behind the moving item, have been found within the retina of lower species, and in the motor pathways of humans. Here, we demonstrate flash-lag employing "second-order" moving and flashed stimuli, defined solely by their binocular-disparity, to circumvent any possible "early" contributions to the effect. A significant flash-lag effect was measured with cyclopean stimuli composed entirely of correlated random dot patterns. When the disparity-defined moving stimulus was replaced with a luminance-defined one, potentially engaging retinal mechanisms, the magnitude of the measured effect showed no significant change. Thus, in primates, though retinal mechanisms may contribute, flash-lag must be explained through cortical processes.},

	Abstract = {Current views of the visual system assume that the primate brain analyses form and motion along largely independent pathways; they provide no insight into why form is sometimes interpreted as motion. In a series of psychophysical and electrophysiological experiments in humans and macaques, here we show that some form information is processed in the prototypical motion areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). First, we show that STS cells respond to dynamic Glass patterns, which contain no coherent motion but suggest a path of motion. Second, we show that when motion signals conflict with form signals suggesting a different path of motion, both humans and monkeys perceive motion in a compromised direction. This compromise also has a correlate in the responses of STS cells, which alter their direction preferences in the presence of conflicting implied motion information. We conclude that cells in the prototypical motion areas in the dorsal visual cortex process form that implies motion. Estimating motion by combining motion cues with form cues may be a strategy to deal with the complexities of motion perception in our natural environment.},

@article{Boxtel:2006rt,
	Abstract = {Motion is fully described by a direction and a speed. The processing of direction information by the visual system has been extensively studied; much less is known, however, about the processing of speed. Although it is generally accepted that the direction of motion is processed by a single motion system, no such consensus exists for speed. Psychophysical data from humans suggest two separate systems processing luminance-based fast and slow speeds, whereas neurophysiological recordings in monkeys generally show continuous speed representation, hinting at a single system. Although the neurophysiological findings hint at a single system, they remain inconclusive as only a limited amount of cells can be measured per study and, possibly, the putative different motion systems are anatomically separate. In three psychophysical motion adaptation experiments, we show that predictions on the basis of the two-motion system hypothesis are not met. Instead, concurrent modeling showed that both here-presented and previous data are consistent with a single system subserving human speed perception. These findings have important implications for computational models of motion processing and the low-level organization of the process.},

	Abstract = {A car driving through the fog appears to move more slowly than one driving on a clear and sunny day. In the laboratory, this observation has been confirmed as a pronounced reduction of perceived speed caused by a reduction in contrast. We measured the influence of contrast on cells in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque, which has been hypothesized to underlie the perception of speed. The influence of contrast on the responsiveness and speed tuning of these cells was pervasive and highly regular. As expected, most cells responded less at low contrast. More importantly, the preferred speed of most cells shifted to lower speeds at lower contrasts. Moreover, approximately one-third of cells surprisingly responded more strongly to slow low-contrast stimuli than to slow high-contrast stimuli. Current models of speed perception suggest that each MT cell votes for its preferred speed, with a vote determined by its firing rate. We tested a number of these labeled-line models by entering the neural responses we recorded from MT and comparing the predictions of the models with the perceptual reports of human subjects and monkeys. Contrary to the perceptual reports, the labeled-line models predicted that perceived speed should increase when contrast is decreased. We therefore conclude that perceived speed is not based on a labeled-line interpretation of MT cells.},

	Abstract = {The macaque middle temporal area (MT) is exquisitely sensitive to visual motion and there is a large amount of evidence that neural activity in MT is tightly correlated with the perception of motion. The mechanisms by which MT neurons achieve their directional selectivity, however, have received considerably less attention. We investigated the motion-energy model as a description of motion mechanisms in macaque MT. We first confirmed one of the predictions of the motion-energy model; macaques-just like humans-perceive a reversed direction of motion when a stimulus reverses contrast with every displacement (reverse-phi). This reversal of perceived direction had a clear correlate in the neural responses of MT cells, which were predictive of the monkey's behavioral decisions. Second, we investigated how multiple motion-energy components are combined. Psychophysical data have been used to argue that motion-energy components representing opposite directions are subtracted from each other. Our data show, however, that the interactions among motion-energy components are more complex. In particular, we found that the influence of a given component on the response to a stimulus consisting of multiple components depends on factors other than the response to that component alone. This suggests that there are subthreshold nonlinear interactions among multiple motion-energy components; these could take place within MT or in earlier stages of the motion network such as V1. We propose a model that captures the complexity of these component interactions by means of a competitive interaction among the components. This provides a better description of the MT responses than the subtractive motion opponency envisaged in the motion-energy model, even when the latter is combined with a gain-control mechanism. The competitive interaction extends the dynamic range of the cells and allows them to provide information on more subtle changes in motion patterns, including changes that are not purely directional.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal latencies delay the registration of the visual signal from a moving object. By the time the visual input reaches brain structures that encode its position, the object has already moved on. Do we perceive the position of a moving object with a delay because of neuronal latencies? Or is there a brain mechanism that compensates for latencies such that we perceive the true position of a moving object in real time? This question has been intensely debated in the context of the flash-lag illusion: a moving object and an object flashed in alignment with it appear to occupy different positions. The moving object is seen ahead of the flash. Does this show that the visual system extrapolates the position of moving objects into the future to compensate for neuronal latencies? Alternative accounts propose that it simply shows that moving and flashed objects are processed with different delays, or that it reflects temporal integration in brain areas that encode position and motion. The flash-lag illusion and the hypotheses put forward to explain it lead to interesting questions about the encoding of position in the brain. Where is the 'where' pathway and how does it work?},

	Abstract = {We extend the local energy model of position detection to cope with temporally varying position signals and the perception of relative position. The extension entails two main components. First, a form of persistence for the position signal based on the temporal impulse response function of the visual system. Secondly, we hypothesise that the perceived relative position of two objects is determined by a slow average of the difference of the objects' position signals. The model explains why briefly flashed static dots are perceived to lag behind continuously visible moving dots, without the need for a motion extrapolation process [Nijhawan, R. (1994). Nature, 370, 256-257]. The dependence of this illusion on parameters such as the velocity, duration, frequency and number of flashes of the motion trajectories is accurately captured by the model. Furthermore, the model makes two predictions. First, briefly flashed dots on a staircase trajectory should lead dots with a long duration. Secondly, it should be possible to abolish the lag-effect between continuously visible and stroboscopically moving objects by halting the continuously visible dots during the interflash interval of the stroboscopic dots. Both predictions are corroborated in experiments.},

	Abstract = {The trajectory of a moving object provides information about its velocity, direction and position. This information can be used to enhance the visual system's ability to detect changes in these parameters. We show that the visibility of the trajectory of a moving object influences the perception of its position. This form of temporal recruitment builds up on a long timescale of approximately 500 ms. Temporary occlusion of the trajectory during this time period reduces recruitment, but does not abolish it. Moreover, we found no spatial restrictions on recruitment on the scale of 10 degrees of arc. When the position of objects on trajectories with different degrees of visibility are compared, this recruitment effect causes spatial offsets. This leads to a visual illusion in which the position of moving objects is misperceived.},
	Annote = {Basic results along the flash lag effect:

How long of a motion stimulus duration does it take for the flash lag effect to disappear? (flash and motion onset simultaneous, outer dots disappear after fixed duration)

answer: exponential decay like 200 msec.

2. Is it temporal duration or soatial extent? Covary velocity and duration and see.

answer: it's temporal duration -- lag angle is proportional to velocity for fixed duration of flash.

3. Effect of number of stations on flash lag effect?

Answer: Increased number of stations drastically decreases lag angle.

4. Recruitment among multiple stations - temporal horizon?
Making stations irregular (this is confusing for subjects -- presented in blocks)
result: flashes outside the temporal horizon do not affect lag angle.

Discussion -- rejects attentional lag, citing Khurana, Cavanagh, and Nijahawan, 1996, but attention *does* modulate the degree of lag.

Facilitation along a trajectory -- "Good interpolation is generally assumed to be restricted to scales on the order of minutes of arc (Fahle and Poggio, 1981)},
