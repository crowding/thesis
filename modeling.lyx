\begin_layout Standard
A schematic explanation of our model is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:model"

\end_inset

.
 Conceptually the model combines two signals to produce decisions about
 motion direction: 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{M_{\Delta}}$
\end_inset

 is an estimate of the change of position of a tracked target, corresponding
 to envelope motion in these stimuli, computed within a restricted region
 illustrated as the smaller, black dotted circle.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{s}$
\end_inset

 is a sum of first order motion energy (carrier motion in these stimuli)
 inside a larger region illustrated by the green dashed outline.
 As can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "mov:stimuli"

\end_inset

, a rightwardÂ carrier on a stationary envelope may produce a perception
 of leftward motion.
 In the schematic 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:model-visual-schematic"

\end_inset

D, when carrier and envelope motion signals are combined, and the two velocity
 measures disagree, the difference is amplified in favor of envelope motion.
 In our model this appears as a nonlinear repulsion 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{I}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{S}$
\end_inset

, we begin by assuming that the strength of the first order motion signal
 is linear with respect to carrier strength 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 However, as spacing decreases and there are more elements within the summation
 region, we expect signals from multiple elements to sum, so that the local
 motion signal is proportionate to the direction content of individual elements
 and inversely proportional to the spacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
M_{S} & =\beta_{S}\frac{2\pi C}{S}\intertext{\,\, or\,\,}M_{s}=\beta_{S}CN
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{S}$
\end_inset

can be expressed in terms of either element number or spacing, since the
 two are inversely related in Experiment 1.
 In Experiment 2 we will attempt to disentangle these alternatives.

 The background shows a typical motion stimulus.
 The motion stimulus contains two sources of information.
 The positional displacement of an individual, attended element is computed
 within a limited region, as illustrated by the smaller, black dashed circle.
 Firoder motion energy is summed over a larger region, a summation of motion
 energy over most or all of the visual field, illustrated by the red dashed
 line.

 The higher order motion mechanism takes differences of a noisy estimate
 of the envelope position of a given element.
 Crowding interferes with estimates of position so that the sensitivity
 to changes in position position 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(S)$
\end_inset

 is an increasing function of the flanker spacing 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 We illustrate a

 as the black dashed circle where interference occurs between elements.

 The first order mechanism sums motion energy over a large field.
 This mechanism is not subject to crowding; more elements in this field
 contribute more to the first-order motion signal.
 This summation region is outlined in green.
 
\series bold
D.

\series default
 The lower order and higher order signals are combined to yield a decision.
 Both carrier and envelope contribute positively to the decision, but difference
s between carrier and envelope velocity are amplified in favor of the envelope.
 Thus, at wide spacings adding carrier motion to a stationary envelope may
 result in repulsion (shaded red region of panel C.) 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\Delta}$
\end_inset

, we assume that envelope motion is computed by taking the difference between
 successive noisy estimates of the position of a given element.
 The sensitivity to envelope motion 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\Delta}$
\end_inset

 will then be inversely proportional to the uncertainty in element position.
 We assume that as flanking elements come closer to the tracked element,
 the visual system will be less able to isolate a single element to determine
 its position, so the sensitivity to changes in position will decline.
 We model this by making 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\Delta_{x}}(S)$
\end_inset

 a sigmoid

 function of the spacing between elements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{\Delta_{x}}(S)=\beta_{0}\left(2-\frac{2}{1+e^{-\frac{S_{C}}{S}}}\right)\intertext{\,\, or\,\,}\beta_{\Delta_{x}}(N)=\beta_{0}\left(2-\frac{2}{1+e^{-\frac{N}{N_{c}}}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function results in sensitivity that approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 at large spacings and approaches zero at small spacings, as plotted in
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:model-uncertainty"

\end_inset

B.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the sensitivity to envelope displacement for isolated, uncrowded targets;
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 describes the distance over which spatial interference between targets
 takes place.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{C}$
\end_inset

 has a natural interpretation as the spacing at which the threshold for
 discriminating a feature (in this case envelope motion) increases by a
 constant factor, which is often used as an empirical definition of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in crowding

\end_inset

.
 As can be seen from this function, our model has envelope motion reaching
 an asymptote for large spacing, and therefore does not change as a function
 of the number of targets, once the targets are sufficiently far apart.
 Again, the dependence of envelope sensitivity on envelope spacing may also
 be expressed as a function of the number of elements, as along as elements
 are distributed evenly around the circle.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(S)$
\end_inset

 is the way it is to satisfy three desiderata; the sensitivity should approach
 an asymptote at wide spacing, the sensitivity should approach zero at narrow
 spacing, and there should be a scale parameter.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, 
\emph on
decreasing the spacing between elements has opposite effects on the first-order
 and higher-order motion
\emph default
 mechanisms.
 For the carrier motion signal, cramming more elements into the summation
 region increases the strength of the signal, since it is a simple summation
 of motion energy within that region.
 For the envelope motion signal, cramming more elements into the summation
 region makes it difficult to estimate the position of any individual element,
 and thereby weakens the signal.
 Thus, decreasing the spacing results in carrier motion having a stronger
 influence on the perceived motion, and envelope motion having a weaker
 influence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One addition to this basic model is required to account for a repulsion
 effectÂ I observed when carrier motion velocity disagrees with envelope
 velocity.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "mov:stimuli"

\end_inset

, it appears that carrier motion leftward, with a stationary envelope, results
 in perceived motion rightward, and vice versa.
 We account for this by a third component in the model 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{I}$
\end_inset

, which is a function of the average carrier strength per element.
 It has a linear term controlled by a coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{I_{a}}$
\end_inset

and a second-order, nonlinear term controlled by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{I_{b}}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{I}=\left(\beta_{I_{a}}C+\beta_{I_{b}}C\text{\left|C\right|}\right),
\]

\end_inset

The nonlinear component was necessary to account for a nonmonotonic effect
 of direction content on subjects' responses (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:results-induced-modeling"

\end_inset

.)

\begin_inset Formula
