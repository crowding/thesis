\begin_layout Standard
Although, as described in the Introduction, first-order and position-defined
 motion have been extensively studied, to date there has been little attempt
 to understand how these two types of visual motion are combined into a
 unified percept.
 Here I describe a series of experiments and a model of how first-order
 and position-defined motion might contribute to the appearance of visual
 motion.
 These experiments revealed complementary effects.
 First-order motion exhibits summation over large areas: the more 'patches
 of motion' there are, the stronger the influence of first-order motion.
 In contrast, position-defined motion exhibits spatial interference: the
 more 'patches of motion' there are, the weaker the positional information.
 The two signals are combined with a subtractive interaction, which, as
 described below, may help to dissociate moving objects from the background.

\begin_layout Standard
Our finding that first-order motion integrates over large areas is consistent
 with the previous literature.
 When observers are asked to detect weak broadband motion signals in noise,
 they can integrate localized motion signals over relatively large regions

 In the case of optic flow stimuli, which may include the rotational carrier
 motion stimuli used in my experiments, summation can take place over much
 of the visual field

However these previous results were based on to detection or direction discrimin
ation at threshold and not to suprathreshold appearance.
 In the present experiments it appears that the large-scale summation of
 first-order motion is not only possible but may even be obligatory.

This doesn't seem to be about spatial scale but about integration - move
 it elsewhere Even when first-order motion strongly conflicts with higher-order
 motion, in conditions where observers report a perception of two overlaid
 motions, they integrate first-order motion over a wide spatial scale [[
 why would the conflict result in a smaller spatial scale? - need to explain
 this]]In a small control experiment I asked observers to attend selectively
 and report either the position-defined motion, discounting the carrier
 motion, or to the global impression of motion; this did not produce any
 significant differences in observers performance, implying that the two
 signals could not be perceptually dissociated.

 Under a wide range of conditions motion judgements are influenced by first-orde
r motion in proportion to the density of elements multiplied by the strength
 of the motion signal.

With the aim of discovering the extent of this spatial summation I controlled
 the circumferential extent of stimuli in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 A limited extent of spatial summation ought to have resulted in saturation
 with stimuli of larger extents which would have resulted resulting in either
 a significant interaction between number and spacing or a better fit of
 responses to element spacing rather than number.
 However, linear summation and dependence on first order motion to number
 still gave a good account of observers' behavior in this experiment.
 While the coefficient of linearity for stimuli in a single hemifield differed
 from that needed to account for stimuli spanning both hemifields (as in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:results-basic"

), unrestricted linear summation withion each hemifield still provided the
 best account of sensitivity to carrier motion for stimuli subtending up
 to 160 degrees of arc.

 One might then wonder why large-scale

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

summation would be part of a mechanism that parses the motion of objects
 from a possibly cluttered environment containing multiple moving objects.
 It seems significant that in the present study, all carrier motions had
 the same rotational direction within each trial.
 This might selectively activate global flow mechanisms which integrate
 over the whole scene

 In this case masking optic flow integration by adding iso-eccentric noise

 might have reduced summation

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 This explanation would imply that optic flow mechanisms processes first-order
 motion independently of other types of motion, for which there is some
 evidence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aaen-Stockdale:2007dq"

\end_inset

.
 This could have been tested by varying the direction of first-order motion
 in my stimuli so as to be incompatible with optic flow mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility is that first-order motion in my stimuli were integrated
 across space as a kind of contour integration.
 Detection of a motion element is facilitated when it aligns in direction
 and position with another moving element 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Verghese:2000aa,Verghese:2002aa"

\end_inset

; when extended to contours formed of image motion, this effect increases
 with the number of elements in a path 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ledgeway:2002aa"

\end_inset

.
 If motion-defined contour integration is selective for first-order motion,
 that might have explained the large extent of summation I observed in my
 experiments.
 This would require that contour integration take place at an earlier or
 parallel stage to mechanisms responding to changes in position, since the
 strength of summation did not depend on the degree to which first-order
 motion conflicted with position-defined motion.
 However, I also observed summation at larger inter-element separations
 than has been found for detection of motion-defined contours in noise 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 To test if contour integration accounts for first-order-motion summation
 in these stimuli, one might adjust the stimulus and task to require segmenting
 the wheel into multiple pieces

\begin_layout Subsection
Position-defined motion does not pool across objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous literature is unclear about whether we might or might not have
 expected global summation for position-defined motion.
 Second-order motion does not appear to define contours 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hess:2000aa"

\end_inset

, and evidence for any processing of second-order optic flow stimuli is
 mixed at best 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cassanello:2011uq,Allard:2013aa"

\end_inset

.
 Even without either of these mechanisms, one might expect observers to
 be able to pool position-defined motion from multiple identically moving
 elements, simply due to probabilitistic cue combination of multiple cues
 within a single modality.
 So it is reasonable to expect at least some improvement of sensitivity
 to position-defined motion when the number of elements is increased.
 However I did not find this.
 The highest sensitivities to envelope motion were achieved when the fewest
 elements were on screen.
 Even when elements were separated by more than their retinal eccentricity,
 so that crowding should not be an issue, there was no improvement in sensitivit
y to envelope motion when extra elements were added.
 Instead, sensitivity to envelope motion remained constant for larger separation
s between elements, and declined as element separation decreased further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since each element also carried some carrier motion, adding more elements
 to the stimulus adds more first-order motion.
 Some studies appear to find that first-order noise interferes with detection
 of second-order stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Edwards:1995fk,Aaen-Stockdale:2012aa"

\end_inset

.
 These studies found that the interference between first- and second- order
 stimuli scaled with the modulation strength of the first-order stimuli.
 However, the first-order component in the stimuli I used was not noise.
 Rather all elements carried identical signals; moreover first-order motion
 was co-located with the position-defined motion, so that there was no spatial
 interference between signal and noise elements as in previous studies.
 Finally, our model demonstrates that varying the strength of the first-order
 motion signal leads to no changes in the sensitivity to position-defined
 motion, only a change in bias.
 Position-defined motion processing does not seem to be subject to interference
 from first order motion in my stimulus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be surprising that envelope motion becomes less, rather than more
 visible when 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flankers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are added which in fact carry identical information.
 This may represent a constraint on how position-defined motion is processed.
 It may be due a limitation of spatial attention, which multiple-object-tracking
 studies have shown is limited to approximately two moving elements per
 hemifield (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pylyshyn:1988fk,Alvarez:2005uq,Cavanagh:2005fk"

\end_inset

, review).
 However, note that since all elements are identical, it is not necessary
 to distinguish target from non-target, as in MOT studies, unless attentional
 tracking is in fact necessary to extract position-defined motion.
 It may also be the case that mechanisms capable of integrating motion among
 objects require more time than the 500 ms stimulus duration I used.

\begin_layout Subsection
Sensitivity to position-defined motion is limited by crowding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible explanation of a loss in sensitivity to envelope motion is that
 it is a loss in sensitivity to position itself (and thereby to changes
 in position.) Some studies have found that localization or form perception
 of second-order stimuli is much poorer than for first-order stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zanker:1997vn,Allen:2004aa"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, other studies find very good spatial precision for second-or
der motion stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Banton:1993ab,Volz:1996aa"

\end_inset

.
 My experiments resolve this apparent difference by showing that the sensitivity
 to position-defined movement is limited by spatial interference from neighborin
g elements.
 In the studies mentioned above, poor resolution was found for motion stimuli
 embedded in noise, while good performance was found for stimuli that were
 isolated against a gray background.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my experiments I determined that the sensitivity to envelope motion was
 controlled by the spacing between each element and its nearest neighbors.
 This finding is typical of the visual phenomenon of crowding (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pelli:2008ao,Whitney:2011vn"

\end_inset

for reviews).
 In crowding the discrimination or identification of a feature suffers when
 surrounded by flankers.
 One can define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the target-flanker separation which achieves some set elevation of threshold
 for discrimination or recognition, analogous to how parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\Delta}$
\end_inset

 operates in the model in this thesis.
 A typical finding has critical spacing approximately half the retinal eccentric
ity, which is in line with my findings for envelope motion.
 However, since 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:results-basic"

\end_inset

 did not distinguish between element spacing and element number as the explanato
ry variable, I constructed 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:results-number"

\end_inset

 to compare these possibilities.
 The results appear to favor element spacing, though the sensitivity of
 this check was less than desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To my knowledge these experiments are the first to establish crowding as
 the bottleneck limiting sensitivity to position-defined motion.
 Previously, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bex:2005zm"

\end_inset

 showed that crowding affects perception of first-order motion in the near
 periphery.
 However, there is an important difference between the first-order case
 and the position-defined case; for first-order motion, the perceived motion
 is affected by the motion carried by the flanker, undergoing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compulsory averaging,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which was consistent with what I found for first-order motion.
 But for position-defined motion I found there was no summation.
 In the literature it seems that there are two manifestations of the crowding
 effect depending on the stimulus: object-level and feature-level.
 At the feature level, discrimination of elementary features like orientation,
 motion direction, spatial frequency, hue, and contrast is impaired in the
 presence of flankers, and there is compulsory averaging 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Parkes:2001aa"

\end_inset

: the perceived feature is some mixture of the target and flanker features.
 At object level, stimuli such as letters, objects, and faces, being juxtapositi
ons of multiple features, cannot be recognized in the presence of flankers,
 but pooling is less obvious; phenomenally the disparate features are mixed
 into a

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 For envelope motion to show no summation suggests that the process subserving
 envelope motion detection in the visual system does not encode changes
 in position prior to the crowding bottleneck, but afterwards.
 Thus position-defined motion is not an elementary feature in the way that
 first-order motion is.
 Instead it can be considered at the object level as a juxtaposition of
 multiple features, if we allow the multiple features to be arranged over
 time as well as space.
 In other words the detection of envelope motion rests on an encoding and
 comparison of successive positions, rather than a low-level encoding of
 movement

A recent hypothesis for the mechanism of visual crowding is that outside
 the fovea, the visual system computes a sort of reduced or

 representation of the visual content of regions

; this summary encodes the density of basic features (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

orientation and first-order motion) as well as some second-order interactions
 between features like junctions and collinearity.
 This summary-statistic model is derived from models of texture perception,
 which effectively makes the claim that crowding and texture are the same
 thing (or, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 put it, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

`crowding' is simply the name we give to texture perception when we do not
 wish it to occur.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

) Crucially, a summary-statistic representation fails to preserve the relative
 position of features when more than one object occupies a given region.
 For example, when targets consist of two crossed bars, the relative location
 of the intersection (which distinguishes a

\end_inset

 Recognition of objects composed of juxtaposed features, such as letters,
 are thus more difficult under crowded conditions.
 An account of crowding as a loss of position information is a natural fit
 for what we see in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

position-defined
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 motion; since position information becomes less precise under crowding,
 so does the motion signal computed from successive positions.

First-order and position-defined motion have a subtractive interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One curious feature of these experiments is that for stimuli with zero envelope
 motion, and weak carrier motion to the left, some but not all observers
 consistently saw the stimuli as moving rightwards.
 Although individual differences in motion perception have been seen previously
 when two types of motion are put into conflict.

\end_inset

 exploited individual differences to investigate how first-order and position-de
fined motion each contribute to the initiation of pursuit.
 However it was still a puzzle why these individual differences should occur
 for a stimulus that only contained carrier motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was eventually explained by my model explaining motion perception as
 a function of carrier and envelope motion along with spacing.
 This model resolved the individual differences into a model of motion response
 that was qualitatively similar for each observer, but for which the proportions
 of contributions of each mechanism differed.
 The revealed that in fact most observers do show repulsion from carrier
 motion, at weak carrier motion and larger spacings; using a weak counterclockwi
se envelope motion biased most observers' responses clockwise.
 I incorporated this into the model as a repulsion parameter

 are more sensitive when stimuli vary two parameters (e.g.

 the old approach of varying only the spacing of an otherwise fixed stimulus.

 to be valuable in my case.
 I varied carrier and envelope motion along with spacing, obtaining a characteri

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model, this repulsion effect is modeled as a nonlinearity where perceived
 direction is a nonmonotonic function of carrier strength; at weak carrier
 strengths there is repulsion, but at stronger carrier strengths repulsion
 ceased and reversed.
 This nonlinearity was necessary because the effect of an increment in carrier
 motion depended nonlinear on the strength of the original carrier motion:
 an increment of carrier motion strength applied to pure counterphase flicker
 led to observers' reporting a direction of motion in the opposite direction
 to that of the increment,while the same increment added to a strong carrier
 motion produced an a stronger perception of motion in the direction of
 the increment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strength of the repulsion effect and its nonlinearity did not appear
 to vary with the number of elements; the same magnitude of repulsion appeared
 to apply to stimuli with two elements as with 4 or 6.
 As a result, at smaller spacings, repulsion is overwhelmed by global summation
 of carrier motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that although we modeled this effect by separating the
 response due to carrier motion into two components - one that depends on
 element number (global summation) and a second component that is not affected
 by global summation that is non-mononic the model fit might not reflect
 the mechanisms involved - it is possible that a single underlying mechanism
 with a non-separable response as a function of global summation and carrier
 strength is involved, or alternatively that separate mechanisms underlie
 the percept of weak and strong carrier motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The repulsion effect may be related to some of the phenomena known as induced
 motion, or the Duncker illusion (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Duncker:1938aa,Reinhardt-Rutland:1988aa"

\end_inset

, review), in which conflict between two component motions leads to an incorrect
 attribution of motion to each component.
 A familiar example of induced motion occurs when the moon is visible between
 low-lying clouds.
 When the clouds move with the wind, it gives rise to an illusion of the
 moon appearing to move in the opposite direction, while the clouds appear
 to be stationary.
 The general pattern is that induced motion arises when there is a difference
 between the motion of a larger field (the clouds in this case) and that
 of a smaller object (the moon.) The tendency is to view the field as stationary
 and attribute the difference in motion to the object; this results in a
 perception of object motion opposite the actual field motion.
 A normative explanation for why induced motion exists may be that large-scale
 motions are more likely to be due to the observer's motion (from motion
 in environment or eye movements) than isolated motion, so in most situations
 a subtractive interaction would result in a more accurate perception of
 object motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my stimulus there is not a large field moving distinctly from a small
 object, but a set of identical objects with identical motion.
 But as discussed above, the spatial scale for integration of first-order
 motion appears to be larger than that for position-defined motion, and
 there is by design a conflict between the two.
 So the ingredients for a conflict between field motion and object motion
 are present, depending on which motion systems contribute to each.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some properties that have been seen for induced motion are similar to what
 I found for repulsion: there is considerable intersubject variability in
 the strength of the illusion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Murakami:1993vn,Zivotofsky:2004aa"

\end_inset

, the strength of the illusion is a nonmonotonic function of the motion
 strength and/or target contrast

LatexCommand citep
key "Murakami:1993vn,Serrano-Pedraza:2010aa"

\end_inset

.
 Induced motion is often explained in terms of antagonism between center
 and surround when integrating motion over space.
 This cannot explain repulsion in my stimuli because its position-defined
 and first-order motion components share the same physical locations.
 However, many of the stimuli used in induced motion experiments can also
 be described as a textural or first-order background motion which conflicts
 with the motion of a salient object, and my stimuli can also be described
 this way.
 Thus there may be a common mechanism of a subtractive interaction between
 first-order and positional motion mechanisms, rather than as a center-surround
 interaction.
 Still it is likely that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Both components are local, in that they are defined within small areas
 of the stimulus, so it is possible to extract both the carrier and envelope
 motion from the stimulus by considering only a small region of the scene
 (slightly larger than the envelope).
 At the same time, both components are global, both (independently) being
 consistent with a single rotating ring of elements.
 From this point of view a global motion mechanism would be one that can
 make use of the entire stimulus, while a local mechanism is one that is
 limited to using only a small portion.

al level visual processing is thought to be more local in the early stages,
 and more global in later stages, as receptive fields increase along the
 visual pathways; envelope motion detection is not evident in early vision,
 so must be computed in one of the later and by imputation more global stages.
 It also accords with the fact that envelope motion potentially carries
 an object of interest across a large distance in the visual scene, so that
 if information about an object is to be maintained or integrated as it
 moves, that process must in some sense span as large a spatial distance
 as the object travels.
 Nonetheless, we disagree with assigning the name

 motion detection we explored in the present study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As we discussed there are multiple ways in the local versus global dichotomy
 can be applied.
 One is that a global mechanism acts over a larger region of space than
 a local mechanism.
 Our results indicate that carrier motion is computed over a larger spatial
 field than the envelope motion.
 Carrier motion appears to summate across regions of space; if one element
 carrying carrier motion causes a certain bias in judgements of motion direction
, two elements will cause twice as much change on observers' responses.
 The region of space over which carrier motion summation is effective is
 large, covering roughly an entire hemifield, with positive summation being
 strongest over separations of roughly the same size as the retinal eccentricity.
 Within the large region of space that it effectively sums over, the mechanism
 integrating carrier motion does not appear to particularly care where the
 motion is located; rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling
 (in envelope) leftward causes as much effect on observers' responses as
 the same rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling rightward.

, reflecting a minimum spatial scale among which a distinct carrier motion
 can be isolated; differing carrier motions belonging to target and flanker
 pool within a a critical region.
 Thus, in our task, carrier motion can pool globally (where our task does
 not ask about the motion of any particular element), and appears to pool
 at at least medium scale when the task is to identify the carrier motion
 of a particular element.
 We see that carrier motion is not particularly specific to location, and
 pools along a medium or large spatial scale depending on task; thus the
 perception of carrier motion is

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In contrast, envelope motion is defined by the change in

 The envelope motion mechanism does not appear to integrate global motion
 information available across the whole visual field; it is equally sensitive
 to the motion of two targets as it is to one target.
 Nor is there a smaller region in which it is capable of integrating information
 across space; in fact the opposite occurs; placing flanking elements closely
 together does not cause summation of envelope motion but rather crowding;
 the ability to identify the envelope motion is destroyed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is even a particularly strong form of crowding; in many instances of
 crowding the loss in precision in discriminating an isolated feature trades
 off against a pooling or summation of that feature within a region defined
 by the critical spacing.

 for orientation, we find that there is a particular spatial scale within
 which an envelope motion element must be isolated in order to be discriminated
 with best sensitivity.
 But unlike those studies found for their respective features, we find no
 summation or pooling of envelope motion within any region of integration.
 In fact, our stimuli always had flankers carrying the

 a situation in which discrimination performance for carrier motion reflects
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 causes no elevation of threshold.
 Nonetheless, discrimination performance for envelope motion collapses under

 processing is hierarchical; mechanisms are called global if they integrate
 and combine the inputs from many local feature detectors.
 This does not appear to characterize the results of our experiment.
 As captured by our model, carrier and envelope motion appear to have independen
t contributions to observers' responses, without interaction.
 A particular increment of carrier motion, depending on stimulus configuration
 and spacing, results in a corresponding change in an observer's propensity
 to respond clockwise, and the size of this change is independent of how
 much envelope motion is also contributing to the observer's response.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To clarify this statement a bit, we note that in our stimuli the envelope
 motion is in a way composed of 
\emph on

 these stimuli must be using the carrier motion.
 This is not the sense of integration we mean, however.
 We mean that the

 of envelope motion, the presence or absence of carrier motion, or its agreement

 they ultimately affect the same decision that the observer makes, but viewed
 on the scale of log-odds of making a decision one way or the other, as
 we have done in our model, there is no interaction between the two.
 As far as the computation of and sensitivity to envelope motion goes, the
 only information about the motion pulses that seems to be used by the envelope
 motion mechanism is their change position -- which is also a feature that
 is

 So we would argue that in our task these two mechanisms are not hierarchically
 related as local and global mechanisms would be, but instead operate relatively
 independently.

 Observers made saccades towards a target moving on a circle of constant

 For human observers, it was found that observers readily initiated pursuit
 in the same direction as the envelope rather than carrier motion; however
 both the position of the initial saccade endpoint and the postsaccadic
 pursuit velocity was biased by the carrier motion.
 This is consistent with the psychophysics on uncrowded stimuli we saw here.
 We also trained a rhesus macaque on the same task and found that the monkey
 could also generate pursuit in agreement with envelope motion (but this
 required some training; pursuit velocities agreeing with carrier motion
 were more prevalent than for human observers.) It also appeared that the
 precision of saccades was affected by target-flanker spacing, similarly

 summation that first-order motion exhibits).
 Perhaps position-motion may use similar mechanisms as feature integration;
 detecting a change in position of a feature over time may be analogous
 to detecting multiple features in a particular relative arrangement, as
 is done in object recognition.
 This leads to an interesting hypothesis: the appearance of object or position
 motion may be carried out in the ventral stream, while most work has focused
 on the dorsal stream.
 Consistent with this, there is some evidence for processing of long-range
 apparent motion in the ventral stream

\begin_layout Subsection
Dichotomies among motion stimuli, motion mechanisms, and motion appearances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the history of visual science there have been many observations that
 there are multiple mechanisms, or more generally aspects, involved in the
 perception of visual motion.
 Different stimuli and parameterizations have been invented to characterize
 these aspects, with the either advocating or rejecting some particular
 boundary between a simple or low-level aspect and a more complicated or
 higher-level aspect.
 There have been multiple strategies employed to draw distinctions between
 motion systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One strategy is to construct a stimulus that can be controlled along some
 variable, such as a continuous spatial or temporal parameter of the stimulus.
 For example, varying the length of displacement is used to distinguish
 long-range from short-range motion [cite], and varying the stimulus asynchrony
 serves to distinguish phi from beta motion [cite, or cite below].
 Here the boundary delineating motion mechanisms is associated with a qualitativ
e change in the appearance, or some response measure, as a function of the
 controlled variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A second strategy begins with stimuli that are 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 distinguished, usually in accordance with a particular hypothesis about
 the functioning of at least one of the motion mechanisms.
 We may compare stimuli designed to drive that mechanism with stimuli that
 are designed to isolate that mechanism (but which still contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some sense.) For example,

\end_inset

 designed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 motion, with the aim of identifying mechanisms that could compute motion
 on .
 Here again, the strategy is to seek a qualitative change between some measure
 that can be used to characterize both systems, and use this qualitative
 change (or its lack) to argue for against a distinction between motion
 mechanisms.
 Since the stimuli used in this approach are distinguished by kind rather
 than by parameterization, extra care is required to distinguish qualitatively
 different responses to two kinds of stimuli from merely less or more effective
 responses from one mechanism.
 However, if this approach succeeds in effectively nulling one motion mechanism
 so that the other carries the perception, large quantitative differences
 can indeed be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Our approach in this work is somewhat of a hybrid of the above approaches.
 Similarly to the second approach, we have constructed our stimuli with
 a low-level and a high-level mechanism in mind, corresponding to the carrier
 strength and envelope motions, and we hope that adjustments to carrier
 or envelope effect changes in the response of the the low-level and high-level
 mechanisms respectively.
 However, more like the first strategy, we prefer to let the differences
 between motion mechanisms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as we continuously vary stimulus parameters.
 What we have observed is that the sensitivity to envelope motion increases
 as the spacing between objects increases spacing, while the sensitivity
 to carrier strength decreases.
 We propose that this illustrates a difference between the operation of
 two mechanisms of motion perception, except, though we have not attempted
 to null the stimulus to either mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not attempt to construct stimuli with the aim of isolating or providing
 null input to any mechanism; rather we consider all motion mechanisms to
 be active for all of our stimuli.

Black is a real sensation, even if it is produced by entire absence of light.
 The sensation of black is different from the lack of all sensation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We posit that the same applies to motion as applies to color.
 A stationary object, or an object with nulled motion, is distinctly different
 from the absence of an object.
 So, for instance, we do not consider pure second-order motion stimuli to
 be absent of first-order content; rather they contain first order content
 that is consistent with a non-moving object.
 In fact all second-order motion stimuli contain considerably more flicker
 than would a stationary object, even if the flicker lacks direction as
 far as first-order mechanisms are concerned.

 which to cleave the lower-level aspect of motion perception from the higher-lev

 in the space of sensation, the space of stimulus configuration, to a delineatio

 There are differences and commonalities between all the approaches, and

.
 Wertheimer's experiments generally involved the use of a tachistoscope
 to present two still images in rapid succession.
 Spatial properties of the images were manipulated as well as the temporal
 interval between stimulus onsets.
 What Wertheimer did that still calls it to relevance was to carefully catalogue
 not only a tally of responses suitable for psychophysical analysis but
 the observers' subjective, phenomenological impressions of the motion stimuli.
 Starting from near simultaneous and increasing, Wertheimer described a
 sequence of qualitatively different forms of stimuli.
 As the inter-stimulus interval increased from zero, there was found: perceived
 simultaneity, ...,

Today we identify the phi-phenomenon with the early, 'first-order' motion

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

We engage in this historical discussion to raise the point that the separate
 motion systems may contribute to the same bottom line in a psychophysical
 experiment such as the one we conducted but are not perceptually equal.
 While we have constructed task which attempts to put carrier and envelope
 motion on equal footing, we are aware that these motions may not have the
 same appearance.
 Even though we engage in a form of 'nulling' by finding stimulus conditions
 in which, given a particular mixture of carrier and envelope, observers
 may equivocate between two alternatives, this does not mean that they perceive
 no motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align block
In some experiments not detailed here, observers adjusted the strength of
 carrier motion versus a constant envelope, until they appeared to be equal.
 The resulting stimuli sometimes had the appearance of a slower motion,
 but at other times appeared to be composed of two layered motions, or other
 percepts.
 The region in which motions had similar strengths were better described
 as 'confusing' than nulling.
 Because of this confusion it was difficult for most observers to select
 one envelope motion strength that balanced the carrier motion, so we were
 not able to obtain precise information from the method of adjustment.

 We noted earlier that the envelope motion mechanism does not integrate
 information over large spatial scales.
 However, it does appear to integrate over longer temporal scales than the
 carrier motion mechanism.
 There is one way in which envelope motion mechanism does integrate information
 over a larger scale than the carrier motion mechanism, but it is a temporal
 rather than spatial scale.
 In some experiments not reported in the main body, we varied the number
 of pulses of the motion elements from 2 to 5 (5 being the number that is
 used in the other experiments, and envelope motion being undefined with
 one pulse), while holding the observers' response time constant.
 At least two pulses are required in principle to define the direction of
 envelope motion; however we found that two pulses were insufficient to
 create any perception of envelope motion; this required at least three
 pulses.
 On the other hand, observers responded well to carrier motion with 1 or
 2 pulses.
 So we conclude that positional motion information is integrated over larger
 temporal scales than first-order information, which accords with previous
 findings (

 What about the sense in which the envelope motion mechanism allows object
 identity and information to be persisted over a very large spatial scale?
 While very large scale jumps of a visual object can be perceived as motion,
 it is unlikely that this represents in integration of information over
 a large scale; if information were integrated, we would expect information
 about the object such as its color or shape to be preserved across the
 jump; instead it is lost.

Motion processing systems may complement each others' limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motion stimuli a person must interpret in the real-world task are in
 many ways much more complicated than the stimuli we construct in an artificial
 experimental setting.
 However, in this thesis I have identified two ways in which motion perception
 appears to be profoundly limited, both of which would appear to only become
 worse as a scene becomes more complicated.
 The first order mechanism which detects carrier motion in our experiment
 is known to be sensitive to very small amounts of motion spread among noise,
 but has little idea of the position of the objects producing that motion.
 In the other hand, the position-defined motion system is confounded by
 clutter, takes several hundred milliseconds to detect a change in position
 of an object, and is less precise [[???]]than the first-order system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How, then, can the visual system make sense of typical, cluttered visual
 scene? The stimuli I use are artificial, with the first-order motion designed
 to provide no information about position-defined motion and vice versa.
 In most real world cases (though not all, See Figure XXX add movie of sprats
 forming a ball to fool dolphins or a squid rippling) , the two components
 will be mutually informative.
 In that case, the different sensitivities and bottlenecks of the two systems
 may complement each other.
 The subtractive interactions I observed between first-order and position-define
d motion may help to boost the visibility of isolated features so that they
 can be tracked; there is evidence that localized first-order motion, when
 it can be bound to a feature, boosts the visibility of that feature allowing
 it to be detected in clutter

.
 Large scale image motion detected by the first order system is typically
 generated by the movement of the organism through the environment, and
 parsing the movement of objects requires discounting the motion signal
 of the background.
 While the first-order system is by far more understood in terms of its
 mechanism, the position-tracking system may be the more important for understan
ding the phenomenal experience of visual motion.
 It seems likely that many aspects of motion vision may be explained by
 by the same processes that underlie phenomena of spatial interference,
 texture perception, and object recognition.

 However, this behavior is not consistent with our separate long-range and

 So while a second-order mechanism seems to exist and is able to detect
 some forms of non-Fourier motion, we do not think a second-order mechanism
 plays a significant explanatory role in our illusion and is not responsible
 for the illusory reversal.
