 At left, the carrier motion is opposite the envelope motion.
 At right, the carrier motion is congruent with the envelope motion.
 (B) Five elements are placed around each circle instead of one; otherwise
 the stimulus is identical to A.
 When elements are placed in close proximity, there is an eccentricity-dependent
 change in appearance.
 The appearance of the wheel on the left (with opposing carrier and envelope

\end_inset

 A single motion element, shown in a space-time diagram.
 Space is shown across the horizontal axis, and time is shown running down
 the vertical axis.
 Elements are Gabor-like with a moving carrier (visible as the tilt in this
 diagram) and a fixed envelope.
 The same motion elements are used for all experiments in this report.
 (B) 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "fig:stimuli-motion-elements"

\end_inset

 Motion elements were constructed of several motion pulses, offset at regular
 intervals in space and time.
 "Envelope displacement" refers to the spatial dimension of the step.
 The temporal dimension was fixed at 100 ms for these experiments.
 (C) 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "fig:stimuli-direction-content"

\end_inset

We varied the directional content of the motion elements by mixing two carriers
 in opposite directions.
 A direction content of 0 is counterphase flicker, with equal energy along
 both directions of carrier motion.
 A direction content of 1 uses only the clockwise carrier.
 The total contrast of counterclockwise and clockwise carriers was fixed
 at 50%.

 For the blue dots, carrier motion is biased to the left, and for the red

 is repulsion.

, observers received visual feedback that their response was either too
 fast or too slow, and the trial was reshuffled into the stimulus set to
 be repeated later in the session.
 An audio click was played each time subjects gave a response; this seemed
 to help subjects establish a consistent rhythm through the experiment.
 No feedback was given as to the direction of observers' responses, only
 whether they had responded within the time window.
 Observers were instructed to report the apparent direction of motion, and
 told that there were no correct answers.
 In some conditions observers reported seeing conflicting directions of
 motion.
 In those cases observers were instructed to report whichever direction
 of motion appeared more salient.

Observers performed the task in sessions of at most 1 hour, divided into
 4 to 6 blocks, and were prompted to take a break between blocks.
 Subjects could also rest at any point by simply delaying fixation.
 At the beginning of each block, the eye tracking system was automatically
 recalibrated by asking the subject to make saccades to a sequence of targets
 at randomly chosen locations on the screen.

Staircase procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the sensitivity of observers to envelope motion, we measured
 psychometric functions of envelope displacement.
 The displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 was placed under computer control, with For each psychometric function
 collected we used two interleaved staircases, one 2up-1down and the other
 2down-1up, to bracket the particular displacement at which subjects were
 equivocal about perceived direction (PSE).
 In a typical session, 6-8 such staircases were collected concurrently,
 with each staircase operating independently and trials from all staircases
 being randomly interleaved.
 Example data from this procedure is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 plotted on the abscissa and the proportion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clockwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 responses on the ordinate.
 In these graphs we scale the area of the drawn points in proportion to
 the number of trials collected at that displacement, to favor a visual
 weighting toward the values where most data was collected.
 note in viewing these graphs that the smaller a point, the further it may
 acceptably lie from the model fit; some values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

, drawn using the smallest dots, may only visited by one trial if that value
 turned out to be far from the PSE; being one trial these points can only
 lie at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$

 data.
 Presuming that observers do not show a particular bias toward either clockwise
 or counterclockwise directions, we may treat counterclockwise direction
 content as being equivalent to clockwise direction content with the opposite
 direction of displacement.
 That is, we assume that the probability of an observer responding

clockwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 given direction content 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and displacement

counterclockwise

\begin_inset Formula $-C$

Effect of spacing

\begin_layout Standard
In these sessions the direction content

 or counterclockwise.) To characterise the effect of spacing we used several
 values of spacing, collecting an independent staircase for each one.

 seem to suggest that the perceived reversal of motion direction is a function
 not only of eccentricity viewing but of an interaction between multiple
 moving elements.
 We explored this spatial interaction by varying the distance between elements
 that were moving at a constant eccentricity.
