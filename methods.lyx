 For the blue dots, carrier motion is biased to the left, and for the red
 dots, carrier motion is biased to the right.
 Note that a leftward shift of the psychometric function reflects that the
 observer respond "clockwise" more often, so this observer sees more countercloc
kwise motion when clockwise content is added to the carrier; that is, there
 is repulsion.

, the observer received visual feedback that their response was either too
 fast or too slow, and the trial was reshuffled into the stimulus set to
 be repeated later in the session.
 An audio click was played each time observers gave a response; this seemed
 to help observers establish a consistent rhythm through the experiment.
 No feedback was given as to the correctness of observers' responses, only
 whether they had responded within the time window.
 Observers were instructed to report the apparent direction of motion, and
 told that there were no

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answers.
 In some conditions observers reported seeing conflicting or overlapping
 directions of motion.
 In those cases observers were advised to choose whichever direction of
 motion appeared more salient.

Observers performed the task in sessions that lasted a maximum of 1 hour,
 divided into 4 to 6 blocks, and were prompted to take a break between blocks.
 Observers could also rest at any point by simply delaying fixation.
 At the beginning of each block, the eye tracking system was automatically
 recalibrated by asking the observer to make saccades to a sequence of targets
 at randomly chosen locations on the screen.

Staircase procedure

\begin_layout Standard
I used staircase procedures to measure the psychometric functions relating
 the proportion of clockwise responses as to the envelope displacement,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

.
 For each psychometric function we used two staircases, one 2-up-1-down
 and the other 2-down-1-up, to bracket the particular displacement at which
 subjects were equivocal about perceived direction (PSE).
 In a typical session, 6-8 pairs of staircases, each with a different stimulus
 configuration, were run concurrently, with each staircase operating independent
ly and trials from all staircases being randomly interleaved.
 Example data from this procedure is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:measurements"

\end_inset

, with envelope displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 plotted on the abscissa and the proportion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clockwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 responses on the ordinate.
 In these graphs we scale the area of the data points to be proportionate
 to the number of trials collected at that displacement.
 Thus, the smaller a data point, the further it may acceptably lie from
 the model fit; some data drawn using the smallest dots may represent a
 single trial at a value of displacement that the staircase procedure did
 not revisit.

Data folding

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When staircase procedures were used, they employed randomized folding; a
 staircase configured to use a carrier strength 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 of 0.2 would actually pseudorandomly present either clockwise (0.2) or counterclo
ckwise (-0.2) carrier motion on each trial, with the staircase-controlled
 envelope motion reversing direction accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I similarly presume that an observer's responses to a stimulus and its mirror
 image are symmetric up to a constant bias.
 Therefore we will present and write about stimuli, without loss of generality,
 as though the carrier motion runs clockwise in all trials, even though
 the underlying data contains a balanced mixture of clockwise and counterclockwi
se trials.
 The mirror image of a trial reverses the sign of three properties: the
 carrier motion, the envelope motion, the envelope motion, and the observer's
 response.
 So, a trial with carrier strength 
\begin_inset Formula $C=-0.2$
\end_inset

 and envelope motion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=0.1$
\end_inset

, where the observer responded 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clockwise,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be presented identically to a trial with carrier strength 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.2$
\end_inset

 and envelope motion 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x=-0.1$
\end_inset

, where the observer responded 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counterclockwise.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I choose the convention that carrier strength is always presented as positive.
 Note that the sign of envelope motion can differ from that of carrier strength,
 so that envelope motion will still take both positive and negative values
 when data is folded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases observers exhibit a bias toward clockwise or counterclockwise
 responses.
 We include a global bias term in our model to account for this - this is
 the only term in the model that is not symmetric.
 We fit the model using unfolded data.
 When drawing fitted curves to illustrate model predictions, we sum out
 the bias by averaging the model predictions for clockwise and counterclockwise
 conditions.
