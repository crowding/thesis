\end_inset

 A single motion element, shown in a space-time diagram.
 Space is shown across the horizontal axis, and time is shown running down
 the vertical axis.
 Elements are Gabor-like with a moving carrier (visible as the tilt in this
 diagram) and a fixed envelope.
 The same motion elements are used for all experiments in this

We varied the directional content of the motion elements by mixing two carriers
 in opposite directions.
 A direction content of 0 is counterphase flicker, with equal energy along
 both directions of carrier motion.
 A direction content of 1 uses only the clockwise carrier.
 The total

 For the blue dots, carrier motion is biased to the left, and for the red
 dots, carrier motion is biased to the right.
 Note that a leftward shift of the psychometric function reflects that the
 observer respond "clockwise" more often, so this observer sees more countercloc
kwise motion when clockwise content is added to the carrier; that is, there
 is repulsion.

 Example data taken at narrow target spacing.
 The slopes of the psychometric functions are shallower and the effect of
 carrier motion is stronger.
 Now the bias is in the direction of the carrier motion; there is assimilation.

, observers received visual feedback that their response was either too
 fast or too slow, and the trial was reshuffled into the stimulus set to
 be repeated later in the session.
 An audio click was played each time subjects gave a response; this seemed
 to help subjects establish a consistent rhythm through the experiment.
 No feedback was given as to the direction

 motion.

Staircase procedure

\begin_layout Standard
To measure the sensitivity of observers to envelope motion, we measured
 psychometric functions 
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384312
measuring the proportion of clockwise responses as a function 
\change_unchanged
of
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384313
 the
\change_unchanged
 envelope displacement

\change_unchanged
For each psychometric function collected we used two interleaved staircases,
 one 2
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384337
-
\change_unchanged
up-1down and the other 2
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384339
-
\change_unchanged
down-1up, to bracket the particular displacement at which subjects were
 equivocal about perceived direction (PSE).
 In a typical session, 6-8 such staircases were collected concurrently,
 with each staircase operating independently and trials from all staircases
 being randomly interleaved.
 Example data from this procedure is shown in

Presuming that observers do not show a particular bias toward either clockwise
 or counterclockwise directions,
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384497
 we can consider 'flipped' versions of the experiment as equivalent, and
 can average data together after flipping the sign of both local and motion
 direction for 
\change_deleted -1683065902 1349384512
 we may treat counterclockwise direction content as being equivalent to
 clockwise direction content with the opposite direction of displacement.
\change_inserted -1683065902 1349384518
one of the directions.

\change_unchanged
 That is, we assume that the probability of an observer responding
