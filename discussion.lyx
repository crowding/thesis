\begin_layout Standard
Physical motion can be defined simply as the change in position of an object,
 over time.
 Visual motion is more challenging to define.
 I presume that it is advantageous for perceptions of visual motion to be
 veridical, that is, to correspond to the changing positions of objects.
 However, the most well-understood mechanisms of visual motion seem to have
 little to do with explicitly tracking changes in position.
 First-order motion mechanisms are instead understood as signaling spatiotempora
l correlations of luminance within limited, stationary windows.
 With the idea of gaining an understanding of how motion as represented
 in the visual system can correspond to objects moving in physical space,
 I constructed stimuli that combining the motion of a carrier wave producing
 first-order motion, with the motion of an envelope that changed position
 over time.
 Arranging these elements in multiples, as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "mov:demo"

\end_inset

, produced the novel effect that the apearance of motion favors its first-order
 or position-defined components as a function of the spacing between elements.
 Investigating how the parameters of these stimuli affected the appearance
 of visual motion led to a model of how first-order and position-defined
 motion contribute to the appearance of visual motion.
 These experiments revealed complementary effects: first-order motion exhibits
 summation over large areas, gaining sensitivity with added signal, while
 position-defined motion exhibits spatial interference, losing sensitivity
 when flankers are introduced.
 The two signals are combined with a subtractive interaction, which may
 explain how moving objects can be dissociated from the background.

When observers are asked to detect weak broadband motion signals in noise,
 they can integrate localized motion signals over relatively large regions

Had some confusion over whether summation is linear or nonlinear.
 Resolved by Burr, Morrone and Vaina 1995: since I have no noise and no
 distractors we would expect linear summation.
\end_layout

 In the case of optic flow stimuli, which may include the rotational carrier
 motion stimuli used in my experiments, summation can take place over much
 of the visual field

\end_inset

.
 These results relate to detection or direction discrimination at threshold
 and not to suprathreshold appearance or to the integration with other forms
 of motion.
 In the present experiments it appears that the large-scale summation of
 first-order motion is not only possible but obligatory.
 Even when first-order motion strongly conflicts with higher-order motion,
 in conditions where observers report a perception of two overlaid motions,
 their motion judgements are influenced by first-order motion in proportion
 to the density of elements multiplied by the strength of the motion signal.
 In a small control experiment I asked observers to attend selectively and
 report either the position-defined motion, discounting the carrier motion,
 or to the global impression of motion; this did not produce any significant
 differences.

\begin_layout Standard
With an aim of discovering the extent of this spatial summation I controlled
 the circumferential extent of stimuli in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

.
 A limited extent of spatial summation ought to have resulted in saturation
 with stimuli of larger extents which would have resulted resulting in either
 a significant interaction of number and spacing or a better fit of responses
 to element spacing rather than number.
 However, linear summation and dependence on first order motion to number
 still gave a good account of observers' behavior in this experiment.
 While the coefficient of linearity for stimuli in a single hemifield differed
 from that needed to account for stimuli spanning both hemifields (as in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

), unrestricted linear summation still provided the best account of sensitivity
 to carrier motion for stimuli subtending up to 160 degrees of arc.

 in peripheral vision.
 One might then wonder how obligatory large-scale summation could be part
 of a mechanism that parses the motion of objects from a possibly cluttered
 environment containing multiple moving objects.
 It seems significant that in the present study, all carrier motions were
 directed in the same rotational direction within each trial.
 This might selectively activate global flow mechanisms which integrate
 over the whole scene

.
 In this case masking optic flow integration by adding iso-eccentric noise
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Maruya:2013aa"

\end_inset

 might suppress summation.
 This explanation requires that optic flow is processed for first-order
 motion independently of other types, for which there is some evidence

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility is that first-order motion in my stimuli is integrated
 across space as a kind of contour integration.
 Detection of a motion element is facilitated when it aligns in direction
 and position with another moving element 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Verghese:2000aa,Verghese:2002aa"

; when extended to contours formed of image motion, this effect increases
 with the number of element in a path 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ledgeway:2002aa"

\end_inset

.
 If motion-defined contour integration is selective for first-order motion,
 it may explain the large extent of summation I observed in my experiments.
 This would require that contour integration take place at an earlier or
 parallel stage to mechanisms responding to changes in position, since the
 strength of summation did not depend on the degree to which first-order
 motion conflicted with position-defined motion.
 However, I also observed summation at larger inter-element separations
 than has been found for detection of motion-defined contours in noise 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 To test if contour integration accounts for first-order-motion summation
 in these stimuli, one might adjust the stimulus and task to require segmenting
 the wheel into multiple pieces

Position-defined motion does not pool among objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We might or might not expect the same global summation for position-defined
 motion that we observed for luminance-defined motion.
 Second-order motion does not appear to define contours 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hess:2000aa"

\end_inset

, and evidence for any processing of second-order optic flow stimuli is
 mixed at best 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cassanello:2011uq,Allard:2013aa"

\end_inset

.
 Even without either of these mechanisms, one might expect observers to
 be able to pool position-defined motion from multiple identically moving
 elements, simply as a combination of multiple cues within a single modality.
 So it is reasonable to expect at least some improvement of sensitivity
 to position-defined motion when the number of elements is increased.
 However I did not find this.
 The highest sensitivities to envelope motion were achieved when the fewest
 elements were on screen.
 Even when elements were separated by more than their retinal eccentricity,
 so that crowding should not be an issue, there was no improvement in sensitivit
y to envelope motion when extra elements were added.
 Instead, sensitivity to envelope motion remained constant for larger separation
s between elements, and declined as element separation decreased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since each element also carried some carrier motion, adding more elements
 to the stimulus adds more first-order motion.
 Some studies appear to find that first-order noise interferes with detection
 of second-order stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Edwards:1995fk,Aaen-Stockdale:2012aa"

\end_inset

.
 These studies found that the interference between first- and second- order
 stimuli scaled with the modulation strength of the first-order stimuli.
 However, the first-order component to the stimuli I used was not noise,
 but rather all elements carried identical signals; moreover first-order
 motion was co-located with the position-defined motion, so that there was
 no spatial interference between signal and noise elements as in the studies
 just mentioned.
 I found that varying the strength of the first-order motion signal led
 to no changes in the sensitivity to position-defined motion, only a change
 in bias.
 So interference from first order motion on position-defined motion does
 not appear to occur in my stimulus, so does not explain the decline in
 sensitivity to envelope motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is surprising that envelope motion becomes less, rather than more visible
 when 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flankers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are added which in fact carry identical information.
 This may represent a constraint on how position-defined motion is processed.
 It may be due a limitation of spatial attention, which multiple-object-tracking
 studies have shown is limited to approximately two moving elements per
 hemifield (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pylyshyn:1988fk,Alvarez:2005uq,Cavanagh:2005fk"

\end_inset

, review).
 However, note that since all elements are identical, it is not necessary
 to distinguish target from non-target, as in MOT studies, unless attentional
 tracking is in fact necessary to extract position-defined motion.
 It may also be the case that mechanisms capable of integrating motion among
 objects require more time than the 500 ms stimulus duration I used.
 The illusion presented by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 shows a case where linking multiple object motions can be seen cantakes
 an appreciable amount of time.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Sensitivity to position-defined motion is limited by crowding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible explanation of a loss in sensitivity to envelope motion is that
 it is a loss in sensitivity to position itself (and thereby to changes
 in position.) Some studies have found that localization or form perception
 of second-order stimuli is much poorer than for first-order stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zanker:1997vn,Allen:2004aa"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, other studies find very good spatial precision for second-or
der motion stimuli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Banton:1993ab,Volz:1996aa"

\end_inset

.
 My experiments resolve this apparent difference by showing that the sensitivity
 to position-defined movement is limited by spatial interference from neighborin
g elements.
 In the studies mentioned above, poor resolution was found for motion stimuli
 embedded in noise, while good performance was found for stimuli that were
 isolated against a gray background.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my experiments I determined that the sensitivity to envelope motion was
 controlled by the spacing between each element and its nearest neighbors.
 This finding is typical of the visual phenomenon of crowding (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pelli:2008ao,Whitney:2011vn"

\end_inset

for reviews).
 In crowding the discrimination or identification of a feature suffers when
 surrounded by flankers.
 One can define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

critical distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the target-flanker separation which achieves some set elevation of threshold
 for discrimination or recognition, analogous to how parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{\Delta}$
\end_inset

 operates in the model in this thesis.
 A typical finding has critical spacing approximately half the retinal eccentric
ity, which is in line with my findings for envelope motion.
 However, since 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:results-basic"

\end_inset

 did not distinguish between element spacing and element number as the explanato
ry variable, I constructed 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:results-number"

\end_inset

 to compare these possibilities.
 The results appear to favor element spacing, though the sensitivity of
 this check was less than desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To my knowledge these experiments are the first to establish crowding as
 the bottleneck limiting sensitivity to position-defined motion.
 Previously, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bex:2005zm"

\end_inset

 showed that crowding affects perception of first-order motion in the near
 periphery.
 However, there is an important difference between the first-order case
 and the position-defined case; for first-order motion, the perceived motion
 is affected by the motion carried by the flanker, undergoing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compulsory averaging,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which was consistent with what I found for first-order motion.
 But for position-defined motion I found there was no summation.
 In the literature it seems that there are two manifestations of the crowding
 effect depending on the stimulus: object-level and feature-level.
 At the feature level, discrimination of elementary features like orientation,
 motion direction, spatial frequency, hue, and contrast is impaired in the
 presence of flankers, and there is compulsory averaging 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Parkes:2001aa"

\end_inset

: the perceived feature is some mixture of the target and flanker features.
 At object level, stimuli such as letters, objects, and faces, being juxtapositi
ons of multiple features, cannot be recognized in the presence of flankers,
 but pooling is less obvious; phenomenally the disparate features are mixed
 into a

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 For envelope motion to show no summation suggests that the process subserving
 envelope motion detection in the visual system does not encode changes
 in position prior to the crowding bottleneck, but afterwards.
 Thus position-defined motion is not an elementary feature in the way that
 first-order motion is.
 Instead it can be considered at the object level as a juxtaposition of
 multiple features, if we allow the multiple features to be arranged over
 time as well as space.
 In other words the detection of envelope motion rests on an encoding and
 comparison of successive positions, rather than a low-level encoding of
 movement

A recent hypothesis for the mechanism of visual crowding is that outside
 the fovea, the visual system computes a sort of reduced or

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 representation of the visual content of regions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

; this summary encodes the density of basic features (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

orientation and first-order motion) as well as some second-order interactions
 between features like junctions and collinearity.
 This summary-statistic model is derived from models of texture perception,
 which effectively makes the claim that crowding and texture are the same
 thing (or, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 put it, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

`crowding' is simply the name we give to texture perception when we do not

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) Crucially, a summary-statistic representation fails to preserve the relative
 position of features when more than one object occupies a given region.
 For example, when targets consist of two crossed bars, the relative location
 of the intersection (which distinguishes a

 Recognition of objects composed of juxtaposed features, such as letters,
 are thus more difficult under crowded conditions.
 An account of crowding as a loss of position information is a natural fit
 for what we see in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 motion; since position information becomes less precise under crowding,
 so does the motion signal computed from successive positions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After first constructing demos such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "mov:demo"

\end_inset

, I started pilot experiments which followed a simple procedure: using stimuli
 with fixed carrier strength and envelope motion, I asked observers to report
 the apparent direction of motion while varying the inter-element spacing.
 I expected that when putting carrier and envelope motion in conflict, apparent
 motion would agree with carrier motion when elements were closely spaced,
 and envelope motion when elements were widely spaced.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Critical distance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be defined as the spacing at which observers equivocated between
 motion directions; this sort of measurement has been used in many studies
 of visual crowding.
 However, only some observers showed equivocation by this procedure; others
 appeared to correctly classify the direction of motion regardless of spacing.
 After trying a stimulus with zero envelope motion it turned out that these
 observers had been responding not to envelope motion but 
\emph on
against 
\emph default
carrier motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That identical stimuli would result in opposite apparent motions for different
 observers is striking.
 Individual differences in motion perception have been seen previously when
 two types of motion are put into conflict.

 exploited individual differences to investigate how first-order and position-de

 However it was still a puzzle why these differences should occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually I tried following the advice of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "Pelli:2008ao"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "Pelli:2008ao"

\end_inset

, supplementary material) who suggested that measurements of crowding phenomena
 are more sensitive when stimuli vary two parameters (e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

stimulus strength vs.
 spacing,) thus obtaining sensitivity as a function of spacing, rather than
 the old approach of varying only the spacing of an otherwise fixed stimulus.
 A measurement over more variables is more time consuming but turned out
 to be valuable in my case.
 I varied carrier and envelope motion along with spacing, obtaining a characteri
zation of the response in three parameters.
 As it turns out, this procedure resolved the individual differences into
 a model of motion response that was qualitatively similar for each observer,
 but for which the proportions of contributions of each mechanism differed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This revealed that in fact most observers do show repulsion from carrier
 motion, at weak carrier motion and larger spacings; using a weak counterclockwi
se envelope motion biased most observers' responses clockwise.
 I incorporated this into the model as a repulsion parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{I}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strength of the repulsion effect and its nonlinearity did not appear
 to vary with the number of elements; the same magnitude of repulsion appeared
 to apply to stimuli with two elements as with 4 or 6.
 As a result, at smaller spacings, repulsion is overwhelmed by global summation
 of carrier motion.
 It was also necessary to add a nonlinear term, since larger clockwise carrier
 strengths turned the apparent motion clockwise (and this was not accounted
 for by the global summation of carrier motion described earlier.) Repulsion
 depends on the strength of carrier motion, nonlinearly: an increment of
 carrier motion strength applied to pure counterphase flicker led to a decrement
 in response rate (i.e.
 observers' responses tended away from the direction of the increment added
 to carrier motion), while the same increment added to stronger motion produced
 an increment in response rate (over and above that was accounted for by
 global motion summation.) In the model, this nonlinearity leads to a nonmonotoni
c function of carrier strength; at weak carrier strengths there is repulsion,
 but at stronger carrier strengths repulsion ceased and reversed.
 This does not necessarily determine whether the actual mechanism is nonmonotoni
c, as the values that are fit in this model depend strongly on what residuals
 are left when global summation is implemented.
 The model fit is effectively separating the response due to carrier motion
 into a component that depends on element number (global summation) and
 a component that does not, which might not reflect the mechanisms involved.
 The mechanism responsible for repulsion may be saturating rather than nonmonoto
nic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The repulsion effect may be related to some of the phenomena known as induced
 motion, or the Duncker illusion (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Duncker:1938aa,Reinhardt-Rutland:1988aa"

\end_inset

, review), in which conflict between two component motions leads to an incorrect
 attribution of motion to each component.
 A familiar example of induced motion occurs when the moon is visible between
 low-lying clouds.
 When the clouds move with the wind, it gives rise to an illusion of the
 moon appearing to move in the opposite direction, while the clouds appear
 to be stationary.
 The general pattern is that induced motion arises when there is a difference
 between the motion of a larger field (the clouds in this case) and that
 of a smaller object (the moon.) The tendency is to view the field as stationary
 and attribute the difference in motion to the object; of the physical situation
 this results in a perception of object motion opposite the actual field
 motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my stimuli there is not a large field moving distinctly from a small
 object, but a set of identical objects with identical motion.
 But as discussed above, the spatial scale for integration of first-order
 motion appears to be larger than that for position-defined motion, and
 there is by design a conflict between the two.
 So the ingredients for a conflict between field motion and object motion
 are present, depending on which motion systems contribute to each.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some properties that have been seen for induced motion are similar to what
 I found for repulsion: there is considerable intersubject variability in
 the strength of the illusion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 strength and/or target contrast

 Induced motion is often explained in terms of antagonism between center
 and surround when integrating motion over space.
 This cannot explain repulsion in my stimuli because its position-defined
 and first-order motion components share the same physical locations.
 However, many of the stimuli used in induced motion experiments can also
 be described as a textural or first-order background motion which conflicts
 with the motion of a salient object, and my stimuli can also be described
 this way.
 Thus some forms of induced motion might be accounted for by a subtractive
 interaction between first-order and positional motion mechanisms, rather
 than as a center-surround interaction.
 Still it is likely that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 It seems likely that many aspects of motion vision in the near periphery
 may be explained by spatial interference (crowding) which limits the precision
 of perceived position and changes thereof, and it is an interesting exercise
 to re-interpret the literature on this basis.
 I have engaged in some mild re-interpretation when relating the current
 findings to the extant literature on visual motion; as discussed in the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, several different boundaries have been drawn between simple and complex
 motion stimuli, so some re-interpretation is always necessary.
 I have attempted to based on the details of the stimuli used by each .

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 form an interesting case.
 They are intermediate between the case where motion stimuli is fully embedded
 in noise and the case where motion elements are isolated; a relatively
 small number of dots are used, and the dots are not randomly replotted.
 This study found that thresholds for second-order radial motion were higher
 than rotational motion, which aligns with the finding that the spatial
 interference due to crowding extends more radially than Brownian motion,
 and there are only a moderate number of dots.

Putting first order motion in conflict with position
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motion perception appears to be mediated by multiple processes that operate
 separately in some ways and interact interact in some other ways.
 In most cases, the first order motion and higher order motion of a moving
 object will agree; however, when they conflict, the manner in which conflicts
 are resolved may reveal an interaction between the two systems.
 Like my study, previous work has put suprathreshold first-order and position-de
fined motion in conflict, which I will briefly review.

 As we have found in our experiments, the sensitivity to envelope (i.e.
 object) motion depends critically on the spacing between the putative objects,
 with critical spacings larger than the typical spacing of the repetition
 of second-order components used in reverse phi stimuli; with this in mind
 it is not surprising that the higher-order component of reverse phi motion

 In contrast we find that our higher order (envelope) motion is perfectly

 flanking objects.

 contrast and a definite orientation.
 Under these conditions the direction of object motion is clearly visible.
 We saw that first order motion

Another way to construct a stimulus that opposes first-order and higher
 order motion is to have a moving window define the higher order motion,
 while the moving window modulates the contrast of an underlying moving
 grating.
 A similar technique is to use localized space-time contrast profiles such
 as Gabor functions whose envelopes progressively change position.
 We treat these as the same class of stimuli because they share in common
 the fact that there is a localized contrast cue to their changing position,
 and because the carrier motion component is narrowband.

 For human observers, it was found that observers readily produced pursuit
 in agreement with envelope rather than carrier motion; however both the
 position of the initial saccade endpoint and the postsaccadic pursuit velocity
 was biased by the direction of carrier motion.
 I trained a rhesus macaque on the same task and found that the monkey could
 also generate pursuit to targets in peripheral vision in agreement with
 their envelope motion.
 When placing multiple identically moving elements on the screen, with one
 designated as the target, we found that the precision of the saccade endpoint
 and the postsaccadic pursuit velocity was limited by target-flanker spacing;
 when flankers were less than about half the eccentricity from the target,
 saccade endpoint errors became large and pursuit velocities started to
 follow the carrier motion rather than the envelope.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dichotomies among motion stimuli, motion mechanisms, and motion appearances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the history of visual science there have been many observations that
 there are multiple mechanisms, or more generally aspects, involved in the
 perception of visual motion.
 Different stimuli and parameterizations have been invented to characterize
 these aspects, with the either advocating or rejecting some particular
 boundary between a simple or low-level aspect and a more complicated or
 higher-level aspect.
 There have been multiple strategies employed to draw distinctions between
 motion systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One strategy is to construct a stimulus that can be controlled along some
 variable, such as a continuous spatial or temporal parameter of the stimulus.
 For example, varying the length of displacement is used to distinguish
 long-range from short-range motion [cite], and varying the stimulus asynchrony
 serves to distinguish phi from beta motion [cite, or cite below].
 Here the boundary delineating motion mechanisms is associated with a qualitativ
e change in the appearance, or some response measure, as a function of the
 controlled variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second strategy begins with stimuli that are 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 distinguished, usually in accordance with a particular hypothesis about
 the functioning of at least one of the motion mechanisms.
 We may compare stimuli designed to drive that mechanism with stimuli that
 are designed to isolate that mechanism (but which still contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some sense.) For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Chubb:1988kx"

\end_inset

 designed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drift balanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 motion, with the aim of identifying mechanisms that could compute motion
 on .
 Here again, the strategy is to seek a qualitative change between some measure
 that can be used to characterize both systems, and use this qualitative
 change (or its lack) to argue for against a distinction between motion
 mechanisms.
 Since the stimuli used in this approach are distinguished by kind rather
 than by parameterization, extra care is required to distinguish qualitatively
 different responses to two kinds of stimuli from merely less or more effective
 responses from one mechanism.
 However, if this approach succeeds in effectively nulling one motion mechanism
 so that the other carries the perception, large quantitative differences
 can indeed be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach in this work is somewhat of a hybrid of the above approaches.
 Similarly to the second approach, we have constructed our stimuli with
 a low-level and a high-level mechanism in mind, corresponding to the carrier
 strength and envelope motions, and we hope that adjustments to carrier
 or envelope effect changes in the response of the the low-level and high-level
 mechanisms respectively.
 However, more like the first strategy, we prefer to let the differences
 between motion mechanisms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as we continuously vary stimulus parameters.
 What we have observed is that the sensitivity to envelope motion increases
 as the spacing between objects increases spacing, while the sensitivity
 to carrier strength decreases.
 We propose that this illustrates a difference between the operation of
 two mechanisms of motion perception, except, though we have not attempted
 to null the stimulus to either mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not attempt to construct stimuli with the aim of isolating or providing
 null input to any mechanism; rather we consider all motion mechanisms to
 be active for all of our stimuli.
 Recall Helmholtz's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 observation that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Black is a real sensation, even if it is produced by entire absence of light.
 The sensation of black is different from the lack of all sensation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We posit that the same applies to motion as applies to color.
 A stationary object, or an object with nulled motion, is distinctly different
 from the absence of an object.
 So, for instance, we do not consider pure second-order motion stimuli to
 be absent of first-order content; rather they contain first order content
 that is consistent with a non-moving object.
 In fact all second-order motion stimuli contain considerably more flicker
 than would a stationary object, even if the flicker lacks direction as
 far as first-order mechanisms are concerned.

.
 Wertheimer's experiments generally involved the use of a tachistoscope
 to present two still images in rapid succession.
 Spatial properties of the images were manipulated as well as the temporal
 interval between stimulus onsets.
 What Wertheimer did that still calls it to relevance was to carefully catalogue
 not only a tally of responses suitable for psychophysical analysis but
 the observers' subjective, phenomenological impressions of the motion stimuli.
 Starting from near simultaneous and increasing, Wertheimer described a
 sequence of qualitatively different forms of stimuli.
 As the inter-stimulus interval increased from zero, there was found: perceived

We engage in this historical discussion to raise the point that the separate
 motion systems may contribute to the same bottom line in a psychophysical
 experiment such as the one we conducted but are not perceptually equal.
 While we have constructed task which attempts to put carrier and envelope
 motion on equal footing, we are aware that these motions may not have the
 same appearance.
 Even though we engage in a form of 'nulling' by finding stimulus conditions
 in which, given a particular mixture of carrier and envelope, observers
 may equivocate between two alternatives, this does not mean that they perceive
 no motion.

In some experiments not detailed here, observers adjusted the strength of
 carrier motion versus a constant envelope, until they appeared to be equal.
 The resulting stimuli sometimes had the appearance of a slower motion,
 but at other times appeared to be composed of two layered motions, or other
 percepts.
 The region in which motions had similar strengths were better described
 as 'confusing' than nulling.
 Because of this confusion it was difficult for most observers to select
 one envelope motion strength that balanced the carrier motion, so we were
 not able to obtain precise information from the method of adjustment.

In the case of my stimulus, neither the carrier or envelope motion

 smaller than) not only the size of the envelope but the spatial scale of
 the oscillation in luminance

 Both components are local, in that they are defined within small areas
 of the stimulus, so it is possible to extract the envelope motion from
 the stimulus by considering only a small region of the scene barely larger
 than the moving element; the same applies to carrier motion.
 At the same time, both components are global, existing and being consistent
 and coherent over the entire range of the stimulus; both the carrier and
 envelope motion are (independently) consistent with a single rotating ring
 of elements.
 If a motion mechanism exists that could pool the motion of multiple features
 over a large area, it should be able to globally pool envelope motion signals
 in our stimulus; the same applies for carrier motion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the envelope motion intuitively accords with the theme that on a physiologic
al level visual processing is thought to be more local in the early stages,
 and more global in later stages, as receptive fields increase along the
 visual pathways; envelope motion detection is not evident in early vision,
 so must be computed in one of the later and by imputation more global stages.
 It also accords with the fact that envelope motion potentially carries
 an object of interest across a large distance in the visual scene, so that
 if information about an object is to be maintained or integrated as it
 moves, that process must in some sense span as large a spatial distance
 as the object travels.
 Nonetheless, we disagree with assigning the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the carrier motion, based on the properties of carrier and envelope
 motion detection we explored in the present study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discussed there are multiple ways in the local versus global dichotomy
 can be applied.
 One is that a global mechanism acts over a larger region of space than
 a local mechanism.
 Our results indicate that carrier motion is computed over a larger spatial
 field than the envelope motion.
 Carrier motion appears to summate across regions of space; if one element
 carrying carrier motion causes a certain bias in judgements of motion direction
, two elements will cause twice as much change on observers' responses.
 The region of space over which carrier motion summation is effective is
 large, covering roughly an entire hemifield, with positive summation being
 strongest over separations of roughly the same size as the retinal eccentricity.
 Within the large region of space that it effectively sums over, the mechanism
 integrating carrier motion does not appear to particularly care where the
 motion is located; rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling
 (in envelope) leftward causes as much effect on observers' responses as
 the same rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling rightward.

When two carrier motions are put next to one another, the identification

, reflecting a minimum spatial scale among which a distinct carrier motion
 can be isolated; differing carrier motions belonging to target and flanker
 pool within a a critical region.
 Thus, in our task, carrier motion can pool globally (where our task does
 not ask about the motion of any particular element), and appears to pool
 at at least medium scale when the task is to identify the carrier motion
 of a particular element.
 We see that carrier motion is not particularly specific to location, and
 pools along a medium or large spatial scale depending on task; thus the
 perception of carrier motion is

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, envelope motion is defined by the change in

 The envelope motion mechanism does not appear to integrate global motion
 information available across the whole visual field; it is equally sensitive
 to the motion of two targets as it is to one target.
 Nor is there a smaller region in which it is capable of integrating information
 across space; in fact the opposite occurs; placing flanking elements closely
 together does not cause summation of envelope motion but rather crowding;
 the ability to identify the envelope motion is destroyed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is even a particularly strong form of crowding; in many instances of
 crowding the loss in precision in discriminating an isolated feature trades
 off against a pooling or summation of that feature within a region defined
 by the critical spacing.
 Like

 found for carrier motion, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 for orientation, we find that there is a particular spatial scale within
 which an envelope motion element must be isolated in order to be discriminated
 with best sensitivity.
 But unlike those studies found for their respective features, we find no
 summation or pooling of envelope motion within any region of integration.
 In fact, our stimuli always had flankers carrying the 
\emph on
identical 
\emph default
envelope motion as any element that may be considered the target; this is
 a situation in which discrimination performance for carrier motion reflects
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obligatory summation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 among crowded targets; for carrier motion a flanker identical to the target
 causes no elevation of threshold.
 Nonetheless, discrimination performance for envelope motion collapses under
 crowded conditions, even though the flankers and target are in agreement.
 So while envelope motion does not exhibit the long range summation that
 carrier motion

\emph default
 it also does not exhibit the medium-range summation that carrier motion

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 processing is hierarchical; mechanisms are called global if they integrate
 and combine the inputs from many local feature detectors.
 This does not appear to characterize the results of our experiment.
 As captured by our model, carrier and envelope motion appear to have independen
t contributions to observers' responses, without interaction.
 A particular increment of carrier motion, depending on stimulus configuration
 and spacing, results in a corresponding change in an observer's propensity
 to respond clockwise, and the size of this change is independent of how
 much envelope motion is also contributing to the observer's response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify this statement a bit, we note that in our stimuli the envelope
 motion is in a way composed of 
\emph on
nothing but
\emph default
 carrier motion signals, so in some sense anything that detects motion in
 these stimuli must be using the carrier motion.
 This is not the sense of integration we mean, however.
 We mean that the 
\emph on

\emph default
 of the carrier motion signal does not appear to be used in the computation
 of envelope motion, the presence or absence of carrier motion, or its agreement
 or disagreement with the does not make observers more or less sensitive
 to changes in the envelope motion; the content of carrier motion only facilitat
es or impedes the perception of envelope motion in the gross sense that
 they ultimately affect the same decision that the observer makes, but viewed
 on the scale of log-odds of making a decision one way or the other, as
 we have done in our model, there is no interaction between the two.
 As far as the computation of and sensitivity to envelope motion goes, the
 only information about the motion pulses that seems to be used by the envelope
 motion mechanism is their change position -- which is also a feature that
 is 
\emph on
not

 used by the carrier motion mechanism itself.
 So we would argue that in our task these two mechanisms are not hierarchically
 related as local and global mechanisms would be, but instead operate relatively
 independently.

 We noted earlier that the envelope motion mechanism does not integrate
 information over large spatial scales.
 However, it does appear to integrate over longer temporal scales than the
 carrier motion mechanism.
 There is one way in which envelope motion mechanism does integrate information
 over a larger scale than the carrier motion mechanism, but it is a temporal
 rather than spatial scale.
 In some experiments not reported in the main body, we varied the number
 of pulses of the motion elements from 2 to 5 (5 being the number that is
 used in the other experiments, and envelope motion being undefined with
 one pulse), while holding the observers' response time constant.
 At least two pulses are required in principle to define the direction of
 envelope motion; however we found that two pulses were insufficient to
 create any perception of envelope motion; this required at least three
 pulses.
 On the other hand, observers responded well to carrier motion with 1 or
 2 pulses.
 So we conclude that positional motion information is integrated over larger
 temporal scales than first-order information, which accords with previous
 findings (

 The first order mechanism which detects carrier motion in our experiment
 is sensitive to very small amounts of motion spread among noise, but has
 little idea of the position of objects producing that motion.
 In the other hand, the global motion system is confounded by clutter, losing

that for a lone element, it is more difficult to discern the direciton of
 its short-range motion than the clear long-range movement.
 By adjusting the parameters to further favor the long-range component,
 we can produce stimuli where the direction of the short-range motion is
 nearly undetectable, yet these stimuli still elicit a motion after-effect
 according only to the direction of hort range motion.
 Nonetheless, these stimuli still elicit a direction-elective response in
 area MT only to the short-range component

 have quantitatively demonstrated the presence of this phenomenon, which
 they term 'motion capture.' That is, the long-range motion is capable of
 masking and obscuring short range motion.
 Additionally, a mechanism driven by a single input nonlinearity (and in
 some formulations, any purely local mechanism

 this is consistent with results showing that adding second-order noise,
 or even coherent second-order motion, does not interfere with the decection
 of first-order motion, but first-order noise does interfere with detection
 of second-order motion

.
 However, this behavior is not consistent with our separate long-range and
 short-range motion; local motion opposes it.
 So while a second-order mechanism seems to exist and is able to detect
 some forms of non-Fourier motion, we do not think a second-order mechanism
 plays a significant explanatory role in our illusion and is not responsible
 for the illusory reversal.

investigated crowding for discrimination of moving objects in a variation
 of the typical crowding task where targets and flankers moved around an
 annulus.
 They found that the size of the region of interference between the target
 and a lateral flanker was invariant with target speed (if anything, there
 was a maximum at 2-4

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (at 75 Hz; at 8 degrees ecentricity, 2 degrees per frame ~21 degrees-of-visual-
angle per second.
 That's a lot faster than out stimuli.) They did find that the zone of interferen
ce around a moving target was asymmetric contingent on motion; a flanker
 moving ahead of the target crowded at a greater distance than a flanker
 that trailed the target.
 If this were simply due to temporal summation (i.e.
 motion blurring,)

show that crowding applies to the identification of direction of motion
 of a textured patch within a window.
 Since the stimulus in that study does not include a global direction component,
 it is not (all of our local motion features are identical.) Actually the
 format of this study shares many similarities to our own, but what they
 establish is the spatial interference of flanking (short-range) motion
 on identification of neighboring patches of (short--range) motion, whereas
 what we identify in this study is the interference of flanking (short-range)
 motion in the identification of (long-range) motion -- this is an interesting
 distinction, as it shows that spatial interference happens in a way that
