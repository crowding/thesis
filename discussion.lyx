\begin_layout Standard
Motion perception appears to be mediated by multiple processes that operated
 in different ways and may interact in some other ways.
 In most cases, the first order motion and higher order motion of a moving
 object will agree; however, when they conflict, the manner in which conflicts
 are resolved may reveal an interaction between the two systems and help
 our understanding of motion perception.
 To put our studies in context we review some previous examples of the use
 of conflicting first-order and higher order motions.

 The luminance-defined motion is given by matching light bars to light,

 This wide bars move to the right while reversing polarity on each frame.
 This gives a second-order (contrast-defined) motion in opposition to the
 first order motion.

 found that the motion that was seen in this display depended on the size
 of the bar and the retinal eccentricity at which the stimulus was viewed;
 in central vision, the second-order motion (rightward in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) was seen at moderate to large bar sizes.
 However, at a retinal eccentricity of 5 degrees, only the first-order motion
 component (leftward) was seen.
 Motion after effects were always opposite first order motion regardless
 of the apparent motion seen.
 Similarly, we saw that whether carrier or envelope motion as seen in our
 stimulus was a function of retinal eccentricity, but we do see envelope
 motion at parafoveal eccentricities, conditional on the amount of clutter,
 as demonstrated in

 used a windowed contrast-reversing grating with widely spaced bars, so
 that the bars stepped (for instance) leftward while reversing contrast,
 as in reverse phi stimuli.
 They found that the direction of apparent motion reversed depending on
 viewing distance, with the apparent motion being leftward (agreeing with
 the step direction) when viewed from near distances in central vision,
 but rightward when viewed from farther distances, or near distances in
 peripheral vision.

 found that the object motion was readily perceived in central vision but
 only the random dot motion was visible in peripheral vision.In psychophysics,
 it was found that the propensity of reporting the object motion isn a theta
 motion display was a sigmoid function of the displacement per frame of
 the window, biased by the opposing random dot motion; we find similarly.

 also analyzed all local, discrete functions of stimulus luminance and found
 there was no single-layer motion detector (as enumerated over this function
 space) that would serve to detect both Fourier motion and theta motion;
 that is, neither first or second order (input rectifying) motion detectors
 could explain the observations of rightward apparent motion from both Fourier
 and theta motion with rightward moving windows.
 A two layer network model was proposed to account for perception of both
 Fourier and object motion.

 Here the interior dots of theta motion were configured to move at right
 angles to the object motion, rather than always opposing, so that they
 would no oppose motion direction judgements.
 Still it was found by measurement of noise thresholds that observers and
 it was found that observers could still perform object motion detection
 under these conditions (however, sensitivity to theta motion was still
 much lower than that for Fourier motion conditions, and declined precipitously
 in the periphery as compared to central vision.)

 finds that stimuli that oppose first-order and higher order motions make
 the higher order motions invisible in the periphery, for even a single
 moving object.
 In contrast we find that higher order (envelope) motion is perfectly visible
 in the periphery, and tends to override the carrier motion, as long as
 the moving object is not crowded by flanking objects.
 How can we reconcile these results? 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

's experiments had the object motion stimulus shown against a noise background,
 so that the motion or flicker was the only cue by which the objects could
 be detected.
 Out experiment does not have a comparable measure; objects are shown against
 a featureless background and are visible as spots that have high contrast
 and a definite orientation.
 Under these conditions the direction of object motion is clearly visible.
 We saw that first order motion per se does not interfere with object motion
 detection in our experiment; there is no amount of carrier motion that
 interferes with the sensitivity to envelope motion, it only gives a bias.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to reconcile 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

's results with our own might be to decide that the features available to
 the higher order motion mechanism do not include first order motion itself.
 To be more specific, the

 This would lead to the observed result that pure

 Indeed our indications in these experiments are that first order motion
 exhibits obligatory summation over large portions of the visual field.
 This is also consonant with the fact that receptive field sizes in MT which

 I'm trying to get at why MT feeds perception rather than V1 with its tiny
 RFs.
 Thinking of attentional modulation indices, which are present in MT but
 absent in V1, as well as MT's correlation with perceptual decisions as

 are very large.
 In our stimuli, moving objects have contrast and orientation which makes
 objects salient, if the perceptual resolution for these static cues is
 finer than that for first oder motion When other features such as contrast
 or orientation are available to signal the presence of objects, higher
 motion uses those features, and is limited by the same bottlenecks that
 limit the localization of those features, i.e.
 crowding.
 This would explain why our observers have no difficulty with detecting
 envelope motion even when carrier motions conflict, so long as flankers
 are distant.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dichotomies among motion stimuli, motion mechanisms, and motion appearances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the history of visual science there have been many observations that
 there are multiple mechanisms, or more generally aspects, involved in the
 perception of visual motion.
 Different stimuli and parameterizations have been invented to characterize
 these aspects, with the either advocating or rejecting some particular
 boundary between a simple or low-level aspect and a more complicated or
 higher-level aspect.
 There have been multiple strategies employed to draw distinctions between
 motion systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One strategy is to construct a stimulus that can be controlled along some
 variable, such as a continuous spatial or temporal parameter of the stimulus.
 For example, varying the length of displacement is used to distinguish
 long-range from short-range motion [cite], and varying the stimulus asynchrony
 serves to distinguish phi from beta motion [cite, or cite below].
 Here the boundary delineating motion mechanisms is associated with a qualitativ
e change in the appearance, or some response measure, as a function of the
 controlled variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second strategy begins with stimuli that are 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 distinguished, usually in accordance with a particular hypothesis about
 the functioning of at least one of the motion mechanisms.
 We may compare stimuli designed to drive that mechanism with stimuli that
 are designed to isolate that mechanism (but which still contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some sense.) For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Chubb:1988kx"

\end_inset

 designed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drift balanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 motion, with the aim of identifying mechanisms that could compute motion
 on .
 Here again, the strategy is to seek a qualitative change between some measure
 that can be used to characterize both systems, and use this qualitative
 change (or its lack) to argue for against a distinction between motion
 mechanisms.
 Since the stimuli used in this approach are distinguished by kind rather
 than by parameterization, extra care is required to distinguish qualitatively
 different responses to two kinds of stimuli from merely less or more effective
 responses from one mechanism.
 However, if this approach succeeds in effectively nulling one motion mechanism
 so that the other carries the perception, large quantitative differences
 can indeed be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach in this work is somewhat of a hybrid of the above approaches.
 Similarly to the second approach, we have constructed our stimuli with
 a low-level and a high-level mechanism in mind, corresponding to the carrier
 strength and envelope motions, and we hope that adjustments to carrier
 or envelope effect changes in the response of the the low-level and high-level
 mechanisms respectively.
 However, more like the first strategy, we prefer to let the differences
 between motion mechanisms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as we continuously vary stimulus parameters.
 What we have observed is that the sensitivity to envelope motion increases
 as the spacing between objects increases spacing, while the sensitivity
 to carrier strength decreases.
 We propose that this illustrates a difference between the operation of
 two mechanisms of motion perception, except, though we have not attempted
 to null the stimulus to either mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not attempt to construct stimuli with the aim of isolating or providing
 null input to any mechanism; rather we consider all motion mechanisms to
 be active for all of our stimuli.
 Recall Helmholtz's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar

 observation that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Black is a real sensation, even if it is produced by entire absence of light.
 The sensation of black is different from the lack of all sensation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We posit that the same applies to motion as applies to color.
 A stationary object, or an object with nulled motion, is distinctly different
 from the absence of an object.
 So, for instance, we do not consider pure second-order motion stimuli to
 be absent of first-order content; rather they contain first order content
 that is consistent with a non-moving object.
 In fact all second-order motion stimuli contain considerably more flicker
 than would a stationary object, even if the flicker lacks direction as
 far as first-order mechanisms are concerned.

Each scheme for exploring has effectively picked a different boundary along
 which to cleave the lower-level aspect of motion perception from the higher-lev

 Interestingly they appear to differ in where the delineation is to defined:
 in the space of sensation, the space of stimulus configuration, to a delineatio
n between mechanisms.
 There are differences and commonalities between all the approaches, and
 we consider how our project relates to each.

 Perhaps the earliest well known discussion of multiple aspects of visual
 motion was due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wertheimer:1912aa,Wertheimer:2012aa"

\end_inset

.
 Wertheimer's experiments generally involved the use of a tachistoscope
 to present two still images in rapid succession.
 Spatial properties of the images were manipulated as well as the temporal
 interval between stimulus onsets.
 What Wertheimer did that still calls it to relevance was to carefully catalogue
 not only a tally of responses suitable for psychophysical analysis but
 the observers' subjective, phenomenological impressions of the motion stimuli.
 Starting from near simultaneous and increasing, Wertheimer described a
 sequence of qualitatively different forms of stimuli.
 As the inter-stimulus interval increased from zero, there was found: perceived
 simultaneity, ...,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Today we identify the phi-phenomenon with the early, 'first-order' motion
 sensing system; this accords both with what we have learned of the physiology
 and psychophysics, and with its subjective appearance as a form of motion
 that is without attachment to object or form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
We engage in this historical discussion to raise the point that the separate
 motion systems may contribute to the same bottom line in a psychophysical
 experiment such as the one we conducted but are not perceptually equal.
 While we have constructed task which attempts to put carrier and envelope
 motion on equal footing, we are aware that these motions may not have the
 same appearance.
 Even though we engage in a form of 'nulling' by finding stimulus conditions
 in which, given a particular mixture of carrier and envelope, observers
 may equivocate between two alternatives, this does not mean that they perceive
 no motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
In some experiments not detailed here, observers adjusted the strength of
 carrier motion versus a constant envelope, until they appeared to be equal.
 The resulting stimuli sometimes had the appearance of a slower motion,
 but at other times appeared to be composed of two layered motions, or other
 percepts.
 The region in which motions had similar strengths were better described
 as 'confusing' than nulling.
 Because of this confusion it was difficult for most observers to select
 one envelope motion strength that balanced the carrier motion, so we were
 not able to obtain precise information from the method of adjustment.

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of our stimulus, neither the carrier or envelope motion 
\emph on

 is constructed to be more local or global than the other.
 For instance, the spatial scale of the step size
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 that defines the envelope motion is similar to (and in uncrowded conditions,
 smaller than) not only the size of the envelope but the spatial scale of
 the oscillation in luminance 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{f}$
\end_inset

 that defines the carrier motion.
 Both components are local, in that they are defined within small areas
 of the stimulus, so it is possible to extract the envelope motion from
 the stimulus by considering only a small region of the scene barely larger
 than the moving element; the same applies to carrier motion.
 At the same time, both components are global, being consistent and coherent
 over the entire range of the stimulus; both the carrier and envelope motion
 are (independently) consistent with a single rotating ring of elements.
 If a motion mechanism exists that could pool the motion of multiple features
 over a large area, it should be able to globally pool envelope motion signals
 in our stimulus; the same applies for carrier motion.

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to the envelope motion intuitively accords with the theme that on a physiologic
al level visual processing is thought to be more local in the early stages,
 and more global in later stages; envelope motion detection is not evident
 in early vision, so must be computed in one of the later, and by imputation
 more global stages.
 It also accords with the fact that envelope motion potentially carries
 an object of interest across a large distance in the visual scene, so that
 if information about an object is to be maintained or integrated as it
 moves, that process must in some sense span as large a spatial distance
 as the object travels.
 Nonetheless, we disagree with assigning the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to the carrier motion, based on the properties of carrier and envelope
 motion detection we explored in the present study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discussed there are multiple ways in the local versus global dichotomy
 can be applied.
 One is that a global mechanism acts over a larger region of space than
 a local mechanism.
 Our results indicate that carrier motion is computed over a larger spatial
 field than the envelope motion.
 Carrier motion appears to summate across regions of space; if one element
 carrying carrier motion causes a certain bias in judgements of motion direction
, two elements will cause twice as much change on observers' responses.
 The region of space over which carrier motion summation is effective is
 large, covering roughly an entire hemifield, with positive summation perhaps
 being strongest over separations of roughly the same size as the retinal
 eccentricity.
 Within the large region of space that it effectively sums over, the mechanism
 integrating carrier motion does not appear to particularly care where the
 motion is located; rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling
 (in envelope) leftward causes as much effect on observers' responses as
 the same rightward carrier motion coming from an element traversing rightward.

, reflecting a minimum spatial scale among which a distinct carrier motion
 can be isolated; differing carrier motions belonging to target and flanker
 pool within a a critical region.
 Thus, in our task, carrier motion can pool globally (our task does not
 ask about the motion of any particular element), and appears to pool at
 at least medium scale when the task is to identify the carrier motion of
 a particular element.
 We see that carrier motion is not particularly specific to location, and
 pools along a medium or large spatial scale depending on task; thus the
 perception of carrier motion is

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, envelope motion is defined by the change in

 stimulus.
 The envelope motion mechanism does not appear to integrate global motion
 information available across the whole visual field; it is equally sensitive
 to the motion of two targets as it is to one target.
 Nor is there a smaller region in which it is capable of integrating information
 across space; in fact the opposite occurs; placing flanking elements closely
 together does not cause summation of envelope motion but rather crowding;
 the ability to identify the envelope motion is destroyed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is even a particularly strong form of crowding; in many instances
 of crowding the loss in precision in discriminating an isolated feature
 trades off against a pooling or summation of that feature within a region
 defined by the critical spacing.
 Like

 found for carrier motion, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for orientation, we find that there is a particular spatial scale within
 which an envelope motion element must be isolated in order to be discriminated
 with best sensitivity.
 But unlike those studies found for their respective features, we find no
 summation or pooling of envelope motion within any region of integration.
 In fact, our stimuli always had flankers carrying the 
\emph on
identical 
\emph default
envelope motion as any element that may be considered the target; this is
 a situation in which discrimination performance for carrier motion reflects
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

obligatory summation

\end_inset

 among crowded targets, thus no elevation of threshold as a function of
 crowding.
 Nonetheless, discrimination performance for envelope motion collapses under
 crowded conditions, even when the flankers and target are in agreement.
 So while envelope motion does not exhibit the long range summation that
 carrier motion can, it also does not exhibit the medium-range summation
 that carrier motion must.
 Apparently the only thing that defines envelope motion is the shift of

 processing is hierarchical; mechanisms are called global if they integrate
 and combine the inputs from many local feature detectors.
 This does not appear to characterize the results of our experiment.
 As captured by our model, carrier and envelope motion appear to have independen
t contributions to observers' responses, without interaction.
 A particular increment of carrier motion, depending on stimulus configuration
 and spacing, results in a corresponding change in an observer's propensity
 to respond clockwise, and the size of this change is independent of how
 much envelope motion is also contributing to the observer's response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify this statement a bit, we note that in our stimuli the envelope
 motion is in a way composed of 
\emph on
nothing but
\emph default
 carrier motion signals, so in some sense anything that detects motion in
 these stimuli must be using the carrier motion.
 This is not the sense of integration we mean, however.
 We mean that the 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 of the carrier motion signal does not appear to be used in the computation
 of envelope motion, the presence or absence of carrier motion, or its agreement
 or disagreement with the does not make observers more or less sensitive
 to changes in the envelope motion; the content of carrier motion only facilitat
es or impedes the perception of envelope motion in the gross sense that
 they ultimately affect the same decision that the observer makes, but viewed
 on the scale of log-odds of making a decision one way or the other, as
 we have done in our model, there is no interaction between the two.
 As far as the computation of and sensitivity to envelope motion goes, the
 only information about the motion pulses that seems to be used by the envelope
 motion mechanism is their change position -- which is also a feature that
 is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 used by the carrier motion mechanism itself.
 So we would argue that in our task these two mechanisms are not hierarchically
 related as local and global mechanisms would be, but instead operate relatively
 independently.

 We noted earlier that the envelope motion mechanism does not integrate
 information over large spatial scales.
 However, it does appear to integrate over longer temporal scales than the
 carrier motion mechanism.
 There is one way in which envelope motion mechanism does integrate information
 over a larger scale than the carrier motion mechanism, but it is a temporal
 rather than spatial scale.
 In some experiments not reported in the main body, we varied the number
 of pulses of the motion elements from 2 to 5 (5 being the number that is
 used in the other experiments, and envelope motion being undefined with
 one pulse), while holding the observers' response time constant.
 At least two pulses are required in principle to define the direction of
 envelope motion; however we found that two pulses were insufficient to
 create any perception of envelope motion; this required at least three
 pulses.
 On the other hand, observers responded well to carrier motion with 1 or
 2 pulses.
 So we conclude that positional motion information is integrated over larger
 temporal scales than first-order information, which accords with previous
 findings (

 While very large scale jumps of a visual object can be perceived as motion,

The motion stimuli a person must interpret in a real-world task such as

 than the stimuli we construct in an artificial experimental setting.
 However, in this this work we have identified two ways in which motion
 perception appears to be profoundly limited, which would appear to only
 become worse as the scenery becomes more complicated.
 The first order mechanism which detects carrier motion in our experiment
 is sensitive to very small amounts of motion spread among noise, but has
 little idea of the position of objects producing that motion.
 In the other hand, the global motion system is confounded by clutter, losing
 the ability to track and takes several hundred milliseconds to detect a
 change in position of an object, and is less precise than the first-order
 system.

 However, this behavior is not consistent with our separate long-range and

 So while a second-order mechanism seems to exist and is able to detect
 some forms of non-Fourier motion, we do not think a second-order mechanism
 plays a significant explanatory role in our illusion and is not responsible
 for the illusory reversal.
