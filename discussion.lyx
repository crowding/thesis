\begin_layout Subsection
Distinguishing between types of motion stimuli and types of motion mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the history of visual science there have been many observations that
 there are multiple mechanisms, or more generally aspects, involved in the
 perception of visual motion.
 Different stimuli and parameterizations have been invented to characterize
 these aspects, with the either advocating or rejecting some particular
 boundary between a simple or low-level aspect and a more complicated or
 higher-level aspect.
 There have been multiple strategies employed to draw distinctions between
 motion systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One strategy is to construct a stimulus that can be controlled along some
 variable, such as a continuous spatial or temporal parameter of the stimulus.
 For example, varying the length of displacement is used to distinguish
 long-range from short-range motion [cite], and varying the stimulus asynchrony
 serves to distinguish phi from beta motion [cite, or cite below].
 Here the boundary delineating motion mechanisms is associated with a qualitativ
e change in the appearance, or some response measure, as a function of the
 controlled variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second strategy begins with stimuli that are 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 distinguished, usually in accordance with a particular hypothesis about
 the functioning of at least one of the motion mechanisms.
 We may compare stimuli designed to drive that mechanism with stimuli that
 are designed to isolate that mechanism (but which still contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some sense.) For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 designed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drift balanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 motion, with the aim of identifying mechanisms that could compute motion
 on .
 Here again, the strategy is to seek a qualitative change between some measure
 that can be used to characterize both systems, and use this qualitative
 change (or its lack) to argue for against a distinction between motion
 mechanisms.
 Since the stimuli used in this approach are distinguished by kind rather
 than by parameterization, extra care is required to distinguish qualitatively
 different responses to two kinds of stimuli from merely less or more effective
 responses from one mechanism.
 However, if this approach succeeds in effectively nulling one motion mechanism
 so that the other carries the perception, large quantitative differences
 can indeed be shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach in this work is somewhat of a hybrid of the above approaches.
 Similarly to the second approach, we have constructed our stimuli with
 a low-level and a high-level mechanism in mind, corresponding to the carrier
 strength and envelope motions, and we hope that adjustments to carrier
 or envelope effect changes in the response of the the low-level and high-level
 mechanisms respectively.
 However, more like the first strategy, we prefer to let the differences
 between motion mechanisms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as we continuously vary stimulus parameters.
 What we have observed is that the sensitivity to envelope motion increases
 as the spacing between objects increases spacing, while the sensitivity
 to carrier strength decreases.
 We propose that this illustrates a difference between the operation of
 two mechanisms of motion perception, except, though we have not attempted
 to null the stimulus to either mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not attempt to construct stimuli with the aim of isolating or providing
 null input to any mechanism; rather we consider all motion mechanisms to
 be active for all of our stimuli.
 Recall Helmholtz's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 observation that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Black is a real sensation, even if it is produced by entire absence of light.
 The sensation of black is different from the lack of all sensation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We posit that the same applies to motion as applies to color.
 A stationary object, or an object with nulled motion, is distinctly different
 from the absence of an object.
 So, for instance, we do not consider pure second-order motion stimuli to
 be absent of first-order content; rather they contain first order content
 that is consistent with a non-moving object.
 In fact all second-order motion stimuli contain considerably more flicker
 than would a stationary object, even if the flicker lacks direction as
 far as first-order mechanisms are concerned.

Each scheme for exploring has effectively picked a different boundary along
 which to cleave the lower-level aspect of motion perception from the higher-lev
el aspect.
 Interestingly they appear to differ in where the delineation is to defined:
 in the space of sensation, the space of stimulus configuration, to a delineatio
n between mechanisms.
 There are differences and commonalities between all the approaches, and
 we consider how our project relates to each.

 Perhaps the earliest observation of multiple aspects of visual motion was
 due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Wertheimer:1912aa,Wertheimer:2012aa"

\end_inset

.
 Wertheimer's experiments generally involved the use of a tachistoscope
 to present two still images in rapid succession.
 Spatial properties of the images were manipulated as well as the temporal
 interval between stimulus onsets.
 What Wertheimer did that still calls it to relevance was to carefully catalogue
 not only a tally of responses suitable for psychophysical analysis but
 the observers' subjective, phenomenological impressions of the motion stimuli.
 Starting from near simultaneous and increasing, Wertheimer described a
 sequence of qualitatively different forms of stimuli.
 As the inter-stimulus interval increased from zero, there was found: perceived
 simultaneity, ...,

 motion, and finally, succession.
 Wertheimer also found that the phi-phenomenon and the optimal motion phenomena
 were most easily

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today we identify the phi-phenomenon with the early, 'first-order' motion
 sensing system; this accords both with what we have learned of the physiology
 and psychophysics, and with its subjective appearance as a form of motion
 that is without attachment to object or form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align right
We engage in this historical discussion to raise the point that the separate
 motion systems may contribute to the same bottom line in a psychophysical
 experiment such as the one we conducted but are not perceptually equal.
 While we have constructed task which attempts to put carrier and envelope
 motion on equal footing, we are aware that these motions may not have the
 same appearance.
 Even though we engage in a form of 'nulling' by finding stimulus conditions
 in which, given a particular mixture of carrier and envelope, observers
 may equivocate between two alternatives, this does not mean that they perceive
 no motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align right
In some experiments not detailed here, observers adjusted the strength of
 carrier motion versus a constant envelope, until they appeared to be equal.
 The resulting stimuli sometimes had the appearance of a slower motion,
 but at other times appeared to be composed of two layered motions, or other
 percepts.
 The region in which motions had similar strengths were better described
 as 'confusing' than nulling.
 Because of this confusion it was difficult for most observers to select
 one envelope motion strength that balanced the carrier motion, so we were
 not able to obtain precise information

.
 Another ambiguity is whether the distinction is stimulus-centered or mechanism-
centered; it might describe the components of the stimulus being used, or
 whether the neural mechanisms imputed to respond differentially to these
 components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of our stimulus, neither the carrier or envelope motion 
\emph on
as a stimulus
\emph default
 is constructed to be more local or global than the other.
 For instance, the spatial scale of the step size
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 that defines the envelope motion is similar to (and in uncrowded conditions,
 smaller than) not only the size of the envelope but the spatial scale of
 the oscillation in luminance 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{f}$
\end_inset

 that defines the carrier motion.
 Both components are local, in that they are defined within small areas
 of the stimulus, so it is possible to extract the envelope motion from
 the stimulus by considering only a small region of the scene barely larger
 than the moving element; the same applies to carrier motion.
 At the same time, both components are global, being consistent and coherent
 over the entire range of the stimulus; both the carrier and envelope motion
 are (independently) consistent with a single rotating ring of elements.
 If a motion mechanism exists that could pool the motion of multiple features
 over a large area, it should be able to globally pool envelope motion signals
 in our stimulus; the same applies for carrier motion.

(There is one sense in which the envelope motion we use is more global;
 it has a longer timescale, being defined as a difference in position between

 to describe the motion of the carrier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Based on the results of our experiments, we assert the opposite: the carrier
 motion mechanism is more global then the envelope motion mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the envelope motion intuitively accords with the theme that on a physiologic
al level visual processing is thought to be more local in the early stages,
 and more global in later stages; envelope motion detection is not evident
 in early vision, so must be computed in one of the later, and by imputation
 more global stages.
 It also accords with the fact that envelope motion potentially carries
 an object of interest across a large distance in the visual scene, so that
 if information about an object is to be maintained or integrated as it
 moves, that process must in some sense span as large a spatial distance
 as the object travels.
 Nonetheless, we disagree with assigning the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the carrier motion, based on the properties of carrier and envelope
 motion detection we explored in the present study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we discussed there may be multiple ways in the local versus global dichotomy
 can be applied.
 One is that a global mechanism can, or must, act over a larger region of
 space than the local mechanism.
 Our results indicate that carrier motion is computed over a larger spatial
 field than the envelope motion.
 Carrier motion appears to summate across regions of space; if one element
 carrying carrier motion causes a certain bias in judgements of motion direction
, two elements will cause twice as much change on observers' responses.
 The region of space over which carrier motion summation is effective is
 large, covering roughly an entire hemifield, with positive summation perhaps
 being strongest over separations of roughly the same size as the retinal
 eccentricity.
 Within the large region of space that it effectively sums over, the mechanism
 integrating carrier motion does not appear to particularly care where the
 motion is located; rightward carrier motion coming from an element traveling
 (in envelope) leftward causes as much effect on observers' responses as
 the same rightward carrier motion coming from an element traversing rightward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
When two carrier motions are put next to one another, the identification
 of the carrier of a single element is impaired by the flanker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bex:2005zm"

\end_inset

, reflecting a minimum spatial scale among which a distinct carrier motion
 can be isolated; differing carrier motions belonging to target and flanker
 pool within a a critical region.
 Thus, in our task, carrier motion can pool globally (our task does not
 ask about the motion of any particular element), and appears to pool at
 at least medium scale when the task is to identify the carrier motion of
 a particular element.
 We see that carrier motion is not particularly specific to location, and
 pools along a medium or large spatial scale depending on task; thus the
 perception of carrier motion is 
\emph on
global.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, envelope motion is defined by the change in 
\emph on
location
\emph default
 of distinct elements, so is intrinsically sensitive to their particular
 locations (or changes thereof.) The envelope motion mechanism does not appear
 to integrate global motion information available across the whole visual
 field; it is equally sensitive to the motion of two targets as it is to
 one target.
 Nor is there a smaller region in which it is capable of integrating information
 across space; in fact the opposite occurs; placing flanking elements closely
 together does not cause summation of envelope motion but rather crowding;
 the ability to identify the envelope motion is destroyed.
 by adding additional elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is even a particularly strong form of crowding; in many instances
 of crowding the loss in precision in discriminating an isolated feature
 trades off against a pooling or summation of that feature within a region
 defined by the critical spacing.
 Like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bex:2005zm"

\end_inset

 found for carrier motion, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mareschal:2010fk"

\end_inset

 for orientation, we find that there is a particular spatial scale within
 which an envelope motion element must be isolated in order to be discriminated
 with best sensitivity.
 But unlike the case for carrier motion, we find no summation or pooling
 of envelope motion within any region of integration.
 In fact, our experiment always has flankers carrying the 
\emph on
identical 
\emph default
envelope motion as any element that may be considered the target; this is
 a situation in which discrimination performance for carrier motion reflects
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obligatory summation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 among crowded targets, thus no elevation of threshold as a function of
 crowding.
 Nonetheless, discrimination performance for envelope motion collapses under
 crowded conditions, even when the flankers and target are in agreement.
 So while envelope motion does not exhibit the long range summation that
 carrier motion can, it also does not exhibit the medium-range summation
 that carrier motion must.
 Apparently the only thing that defines envelope motion is the shift of
 the envelope of a 
\emph on
single

 element; envelope motion detection appears to be completely 
\emph on

(though subject to nonlocal interference.)

\begin_layout Standard
The other sense in which distinctions have been drawn between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 processing is hierarchical; global mechanisms integrate and combine the
 inputs from many local feature detectors.
 This does not appear to characterize the results of our experiment.
 As captured by our model, carrier and envelope motion appear to have independen
t contributions to observers' responses, without interaction.
 A particular increment of carrier motion, depending on stimulus configuration
 and spacing, results in a corresponding change in an observer's propensity
 to respond clockwise, and the size of this change is independent of how
 much envelope motion is also contributing to the observer's response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify this statement a bit, we note that in our stimuli the envelope
 motion is in a way composed of 
\emph on
nothing but
\emph default
 carrier motion signals, so in some sense anything that detects motion in
 these stimuli must be using the carrier motion.
 This is not the sense of integration we mean, however.
 We mean that the 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 of the carrier motion signal does not appear to be used in the computation
 of envelope motion, the presence or absence of carrier motion, or its agreement
 or disagreement with the does not make observers more or less sensitive
 to changes in the envelope motion; the content of carrier motion only facilitat
es or impedes the perception of envelope motion in the gross sense that
 they ultimately affect the same decision that the observer makes, but viewed
 on the scale of log-odds of making a decision one way or the other, as
 we have done in our model, there is no interaction between the two.
 As far as the computation of and sensitivity to envelope motion goes, the
 only information about the motion pulses that seems to be used by the envelope
 motion mechanism is their change position -- which is also a feature that
 is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 used by the carrier motion mechanism itself.
 So we would argue that in our task these two mechanisms are not hierarchically
 related as local and global mechanisms would be, but instead operate relatively
 independently.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 We noted earlier that the envelope motion mechanism does not integrate
 information over large spatial scales.
 However, it does appear to integrate over longer temporal scales than the
 carrier motion mechanism.
 There is one way in which envelope motion mechanism does integrate information
 over a larger scale than the carrier motion mechanism, but it is a temporal
 rather than spatial scale.
 In some experiments not reported in the main body, we varied the number
 of pulses of the motion elements from 2 to 5 (5 being the number that is
 used in the other experiments, and envelope motion being undefined with
 one pulse), while holding the observers' response time constant.
 At least two pulses are required in principle to define the direction of
 envelope motion; however we found that two pulses were insufficient to
 create any perception of envelope motion; this required at least three
 pulses.
 On the other hand, observers responded well to carrier motion with 1 or
 2 pulses.
 So we conclude that positional motion information is integrated over larger
 temporal scales than first-order information, which accords with previous
 findings (

 What about the sense in which the envelope motion mechanism allows object
 identity and information to be persisted over a very large spatial scale?
 While very large scale jumps of a visual object can be perceived as motion,
 it is unlikely that this represents in integration of information over
 a large scale; if information were integrated, we would expect information
 about the object such as its color or shape to be preserved across the
 jump; instead it is lost.

 describes a pattern of motion over the entire visual field that is consistent
 with being generated by the motion of an observer through the environment,
 opposed to the motion of objects relative to a stationary observer.
 The simplest examples of optic flow stimuli are patterns such as global
 expantion or contraction, or rotation around a central point.
 The patterns of motion that in our motion illusion are consistent with
 a rotation around the axis parallel to the viewer's gaze, so an optic flow
 mechanism is likely being driven my our stimulus.
 This raises the question of whether optic flow mechanisms are involved
 in the illusion of reversal.

that for a lone element, it is more difficult to discern the direciton of
 its short-range motion than the clear long-range movement.
 By adjusting the parameters to further favor the long-range component,
 we can produce stimuli where the direction of the short-range motion is
 nearly undetectable, yet these stimuli still elicit a motion after-effect
 according only to the direction of hort range motion.
 Nonetheless, these stimuli still elicit a direction-elective response in

 masking and obscuring short range motion.
 Additionally, a mechanism driven by a single input nonlinearity (and in
 some formulations, any purely local mechanism

 this is consistent with results showing that adding second-order noise,
 or even coherent second-order motion, does not interfere with the decection
 of first-order motion, but first-order noise does interfere with detection
 of second-order motion

 However, this behavior is not consistent with our separate long-range and
 short-range motion; local motion opposes it.
 So while a second-order mechanism seems to exist and is able to detect
 some forms of non-Fourier motion, we do not think a second-order mechanism
 plays a significant explanatory role in our illusion and is not responsible
 for the illusory reversal.

 of the typical crowding task where targets and flankers moved around an
 annulus.
 They found that the size of the region of interference between the target
 and a lateral flanker was invariant with target speed (if anything, there
 was a maximum at 2-4

 That's a lot faster than out stimuli.) They did find that the zone of interferen
ce around a moving target was asymmetric contingent on motion; a flanker
 moving ahead of the target crowded at a greater distance than a flanker
 that trailed the target.
 If this were simply due to temporal summation (i.e.
 motion blurring,)

 of a textured patch within a window.
 Since the stimulus in that study does not include a global direction component,
 it is not (all of our local motion features are identical.) Actually the
 format of this study shares many similarities to our own, but what they
 establish is the spatial interference of flanking (short-range) motion
 on identification of neighboring patches of (short--range) motion, whereas
 what we identify in this study is the interference of flanking (short-range)
 motion in the identification of (long-range) motion -- this is an interesting
 distinction, as it shows that spatial interference happens in a way that
