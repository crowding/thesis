<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >A model of visual processing of this class of stimuli responses will need to account for changes in
the direction of apparent motion. When elements are isolated, the apparent direction of motion
follows that of the envelopes; when multiple elements are placed in proximity, the direction of
apparent motion changes to agree with that of the carrier. I will proceed to quantify this
reversal effect in subsequent sections. In order to do so I asked naïve observers to make
binary classifications of their impressions of the overall direction of motion (clockwise or
counterclockwise.) However, binary responses collapse together a number of perceptual qualities, so
that these simple direction judgments do not fully capture the appearance of these
stimuli.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Below are three demonstrations that place the fixation point in the center of the screen and the
moving elements on a circle of constant eccentricity. The motion of the individual elements is the
same in each demo; only the spacing and number of elements changes. These movies are arranged
to loop, however the psychophysics I will discuss in subsequent sections is based on brief (<span

circumferentially. In this demonstration the carrier motion is clockwise and the envelope motion is
counterclockwise. For all observers I have shown this stimulus to, the perceived direction of motion
is counterclockwise, in agreement with the envelope motion. This illustrates that higher order
motion can be clearly seen in the periphery, and that at these wide element spacings the envelope
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
motion dominates the perception. Compared to other stimuli it is relatively difficult to tell the
direction of motion of the carrier, so we could say that the envelope motion &#8220;captures&#8221; the carrier
motion (<a

href="_masterli1.html#XHedges:2011aa">2011</a>). For the largest values of carrier strength, (for these demonstrations,
the carrier strength <span 
class="cmmi-12">C </span>as defined in <a

class="cmr-12">100%</span>,) the carrier
motion might appear as a &#8220;wind&#8221; which overlays the moving envelopes, somewhat similar to the
appearance of a low-contrast moving grating superposed on a stationary pedestal grating
(<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XLu:2001fv">Lu and Sperling</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XLu:2001fv">2001</a>). Incidentally, when carrier motions are directed opposite to
envelope motion, as can be seen in <a 
href="_masterse1.html#x2-10011">Figure&#x00A0;1.1</a>, the elements appear to have more flicker,
and the perceived motion, while agreeing in direction with the envelope, seems less
smooth.

<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   As the number of elements in the display increases and the spacing between elements
decreases, the appearance of the motion changes. The demonstration in <a

increases the number of elements to 16; the spacing between elements is <span

class="cmmi-12">e</span>, which seems
close to the &#8220;critical spacing&#8221; for many observers. Generally the carrier motion becomes
more visible and observers begin to equivocate in their reports of perceived motion
direction. The perception is a mixture of both carrier and envelope motions, but the form
of this mixture can take on several different appearances. Observers viewing stimuli
near the critical spacing described a number of different qualitative impressions of the
stimulus:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Transparent motion, in which different layers seemed to slide over each other in opposite
      directions;
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Windowed motion, in which the elements appear to be rotating aperture through which
      a moving background is seen.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Motion that changes direction over time. In these cases the immediate perception was
      usually in agreement with the carrier motion while the later percept was in agreement
      with the envelope motion.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A non-uniform appearance where one side of the wheel appears to move one direction
      and the other side in the other direction.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">A few isolated elements move in agreement with the envelope motion and can be
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      attentively tracked, but non-attended regions of the wheel seem to move in the opposite
      direction.</li></ul>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >The subjective speed of the motion can change as spacing is brought near critical; if carrier motion
opposes envelope motion, the perceived speed of the stimulus reaches a minimum at a certain
spacing, being faster in the direction of envelope motion when spacing is larger and faster in the
direction of carrier motion when spacing is smaller.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Some observers saw motion directions in agreement with the carrier immediately after stimulus
onset which then changes to be more in agreements with the envelope motion. For this
reason I asked observers in <a 
href="_masterse5.html#x6-120005">Experiment 1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-basic --></a> to respond within a restricted time window.
Observers often reported the sensation of giving a mistaken response (i.e.&#x00A0;they gave
a response but their perception of motion changed after they had committed to the
response.)
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   One perceptual phenomenon that did <span 
class="ecti-1200">not </span>seem to occur is bistability. Both the carrier and
envelope motions are individually consistent with a global rotation of the display around the
fixation point, so that we might have anticipated perceptions exclusively consistent one rigid
movement or the other (<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XAnstis:2011vn">Anstis and Kim</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XAnstis:2011vn">2011</a>). However, the appearances of critically spaced
stimuli tended to reflect a mixture of two motions rather than one overriding motion, and
there was never the spontaneous all-at-once switch that occurs for perceptually bistable
stimuli.

When elements are this closely spaced the overall impression is of motion in the direction of the
carrier. There is not as much of the appearance of two separate motions. However, the amount of
subjective flicker does appear to increase when carrier motion is incongruent with envelope
motion.

<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   While I did not describe the stimulus construction in detail to naïve observers, all observers
after having practiced at the task employed in <a 
href="_masterse5.html#x6-120005">Experiment 1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-basic --></a> commented spontaneously on the two
forms of motion being employed. More than one observer when commenting on the
stimuli called the envelope morion &#8220;real&#8221; and the carrier motion &#8220;fake.&#8221; However the two
motions are not equally salient or distinguishable in all conditions; the carrier motion
appears less salient when spacing is wide, with few elements on screen, and envelope
motion is more difficult to discern in the contrary situation. Motion after-effects appear to
always be directed opposite the carrier motion regardless the spacing or the envelope
motion.
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   There seems to be some individual variation as to how relatively strong carrier and envelope
motions are. For some observers I was able to find a configuration of carrier strength, envelope
motion, and spacing which I would perceive as clearly being clockwise but the observer would
perceive as counterclockwise. While appearance was affected by carrier motion, it was not always
affected in the <span 
class="ecti-1200">direction </span>of carrier motion; I sometimes found that adding carrier motion in one
direction to a stimulus prompted a report that the stimulus was now moving in the
opposite direction to the change. Sometimes I could even find a stimulus whose carrier and
envelope motion were clockwise but whose appearance was counterclockwise to a particular
observer. An effort at modeling the processes underlying this behavior will therefore have
to capture this individual variation and the apparent nonlinearity in carrier motion
perception.
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   There are too many stimulus parameters to explore the entire configuration space exhaustively,
but I can report some impressions as to the robustness of the appearance of the stimulus. In
particular I wondered whether the density-driven reversal of apparent motion was robust
to changes in stimulus properties such as element size and eccentricity. A scaling of
critical spacing with eccentricity and robustness of critical spacing against changes in

(<a

href="_masterli1.html#XPelli:2008nx">2008</a>).
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   Adjusting the spacing from wide to narrow by adding more elements revealed a point at which
the appearance of motion changed from envelope-dominated to carrier-dominated. I noted the
spacing (or equivalently the number of elements) at which the appearance seemed to change, while
varying other stimulus parameters. I found that I could vary the eccentricity, size, and
velocity of the envelopes by a factor of 2 in either direction, while the critical spacing
required to induce a change in motion appearance remained roughly the same. Similarly I
could vary the spatial frequency and temporal frequency of the carrier by a factor of 2
in either direction without much affecting the critical spacing. At the extremes of the
configuration space, the change in character of the motion was present among other
percepts of motion, and could become hard to distinguish. The largest effect seemed to be
for spatial frequency and element size, for which a change of a factor of four (going
from 0.67 to 2.67 cycles per degree at 10 degrees eccentricity, the element size scaling
inversely) only modestly increased the number of elements required for reversal, from 13 to
18. Scaling all spatial parameters (element size, eccentricity, envelope velocity, spatial
frequency) at once did not affect the spacing at reversal; the critical spacing scaled with
eccentricity.
<!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >   The demonstrations shown in <a 
href="_masterse1.html#x2-10011">Figure&#x00A0;1.1</a> and in this section suggest that multiple motion
elements placed in proximity in peripheral vision interact in such a way that the carrier motion
becomes more perceptually salient and the envelope motion less so. When envelope and carrier
motion are put into conflict, the inter-element spacing (depending on retinal eccentricity) appears
to be the most reliable determinant of which component wins. In the following sections I report
psychophysical experiments designed to capture and model the determining factors explaining
perceived motion direction.
