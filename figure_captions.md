##Movie 1 (four wheels)

##Figure 1

Stimulus parameters

A. A single motion pulse, shown as an X-T diagram along the
   elements' centroid. Elements are Gabor-like with a moving carrier
   (visible as the tilt in this diagram) and a fixed envelope. The
   same motion elements are used for all experiments in this report.

B. We varied the directional content of the motion elements by mixing
   two carriers in opposite directions. A direction content of 0 has
   pure counterphase, with equal energy along both directions of
   carrier motion. A direction content of 1 uses only the clockwise
   carrier. The total contrast of counterclockwise and clockwise
   carriers was fixed at 50%.
   
C. Motion elements were constructed of several motion pulses, offset at
   regular intervals in space and time. "Envelope displacement" refers
   to the spatial dimension of the step. The temporal dimension was
   fixed at 100 ms for these experiments.

D. Stimuli comprised several motion elements arranged around a circle,
   with the directions of carrier and envelope motion along its
   circumference.

## Movie 2 (example stimuli)

## Figure 2

Effect of direction content at wide and narrow spacing.

A. Example data taken at wide target spacing. We measured the
   proportion of subjects responding clockwise" while varying the
   envelope displacement (horizontal axis) and the carrier direction
   content (colors.) Note that a leftward shift of the psychometric
   function indicates that the observer respond "clockwise" more
   often, so this observer sees more counterclockwise motion when
   clockwise content is added to the carrier. (i.e. repulsion)
   
B. Example data taken at narrow target spacing. The slope of the
   psychometric function decreases, and the effect of the 
   
C. Schematic illustrating measures of interest (bias and sensitivity)

D. Row 1: Bias as a function of direction content for N
          subjects. Colors indicate spacing (wide or narrow.) Both
          clockwise and counterclockwise carriers were used, but data
          here incorporate both cases into "positive" direction content.
		  
   Row 2: Sensitivity as a function of direction content.
   
##Figure 3

Spacing manipulation. Direction content was held constant (randomized
between clockwise and counterclockwise

A. Example data for three subjects. For NJ, spacing appears to shift
   the psychometric function. For JB, spacing appears to flatten the
   psychometric function without shifting the point of subjective
   equality. For PBM, a combination of the effects is evident.

B. Row 1: Bias as a function of element spacing for N subjects.

C. Row 2: Sensitivity as a function of spacing.

##Figure 4

Number and density experiment.

A. Example stimuli. Elements were presented in one hemifield. There
   are stationary flankers, which have zero direction content and zero
   displacement.

B. The combinations of element number (not including flanker) and
   element spacing used.)

C. Example data for two subjects. Colors indicate the number of
   targets. Element spacing explains most of the variation in PBM's
   responses but does not explain NJ's responses.
   
D. The same data replotted with color and x-axis swapped. Element
   number explains most of NJ's variation but not PBM's.
   
E. A regression is fit to this data giving two coefficients, one
   corresponding to spacing and the other corresponding to plotted for
   each subject. We collapse this onto one measure X (diagonal lines.)
   
## Movie 2. (number/density demo)
   
## Figure 5.

A. Motion energy example. The amount of motion energy in the stimulus
   is measured and plotted as a function of displacement for an
   experiment with zero carrier direction content. The motion energy
   explains some o the subject's responses. (See supplementary figure for
   motion energy calculation?)
   
B. Subject ML was tested at two different values of direction contrast
   which led to two different measures of number/density
   dependence. We overlay that data on the original psychometric
   functions and argue that at one value, the measurement is more
   sensitive to shifts of the psychometric function, and at the other,
   the measure is more sensitive to slopes.
   
C. Data from figures 2 and 3 has been modeled with a bias that depends
   on the number of elements in the stimulus, and a slope that depends
   on the target spacing (and something corresponding to obligatory
   summation within the critical distance???) Example fits to data?
   
D. The number/density measure (from Figure 4) is plotted against the
   fitted parameters for psychometric function shift and sensitivity
   change. (Hopefully there is a correspondence.)
