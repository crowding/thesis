<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >In <a 
href="_masterse5.html#x6-120005">Experiment 1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-basic --></a> I reported that judgements of motion direction were more sensitive to envelope
motion when spacing is large. In that experiment, because spacing was determined by changing the
number of elements, the same results could equally well be described as sensitivity being higher
when there are fewer elements. Similarly, in the case of carrier motion, I modeled the sensitivity to
carrier motion as being proportional to the number of identical elements, but it could also be
described as inversely proportional to the spacing between elements. Mathematically this would be
expressed by substituting <span 
class="cmmi-12">N </span>for <img 
src="_master35x.png" alt="2&#x03C0;r
 S"  class="frac" align="middle"> in the model formulation or vice versa. This leaves the
question of which variable provides a better characterization of motion perception in this
task.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="#x7-280006">Experiment 2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-number --></a> attempts to resolve the confounding of spacing and element number, to
determine which provides a better characterization of motion perception in this task. The
answer does not have to be the same for both types of motion; sensitivity to envelope
motion may be determined by number while sensitive to number whereas sensitivity
to carrier motion is determined by spacing, or vice versa. Another way to frame the
question is to ask whether the changes in sensitivity to envelope and carrier motion
are due to influences from nearby flankers, or due to effects at a larger scale. For both
carrier and envelope motion, a dependency on element spacing (as opposed to number)
would imply a <span

class="small-caps">O</span><span 
class="small-caps">C</span><span 
class="small-caps">A</span><span 
class="small-caps">L</span> </span>process, sensitive to the immediate context of each element but
insensitive to elements farther away. Conversely a dependence on element number would

class="small-caps">B</span><span 
class="small-caps">A</span><span 
class="small-caps">L</span> </span>process, which combines information across multiple elements even
at large separations. To distinguish these alternatives, in <a 
href="#x7-280006">Experiment 2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-number --></a> I used stimuli
which decoupled the number of elements from the element spacing by creating a display
where the elements cover only a portion of the scene. I did this by varying the <span 
class="ecti-1200">extent </span>of
the stimulus, defined as the circumferential distance covered by the array of moving
elements, as shown in <a 
href="#x7-290011">Figure&#x00A0;6.1</a>. That is, the elements form a partial instead of a full
circle.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   If the array of elements covers only a portion of the scene, spacing and number can be varied
independently. This involves varying the <span 
class="ecti-1200">extent </span>of the stimulus, defined as the circumferential
distance covered by the array of moving elements. Any two of these variables (spacing, number,
and extent) determine the third, so I will somewhat arbitrarily focus on spacing and element
number as the relevant variables.

eccentricity. The stimulus consisted of evenly spaced moving elements, identical to those in
<a 
href="_masterse5.html#x6-120005">Experiment 1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:results-basic --></a>, but instead of being distributed around the entire circle, the elements were
distributed along a partial-circle on either the left or right wide of the display. Stimuli were
positioned either left or right of the fixation point. In pilot experiments observers found it difficult
to judge the direction of motion if the stimulus appeared in a random location on each trial, so
stimuli alternated between hemifields in blocks. Each session used an equal number of stimuli
positioned in the left and right hemifields, with the position alternating in blocks of 100 to 200
trials.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   I varied both the spacing and the number of elements used; accordingly, the total spatial extent
of the stimulus varied from trial to trial. The stimuli used are plotted in <a 
href="#x7-290033">Figure&#x00A0;6.3</a>.
This stimulus set was constructed so that each value of spacing was tested using more
than one value for the element number, and vice versa. I chose a set of stimuli that was
symmetrically arranged in element number and spacing, spanning a similar range for both
variables (covering a factor of 2.67 in element number and a factor of 2.78 in element
spacing.)

indicated in <a

no envelope movement and zero carrier strength (i.e.,&#x00A0;they flickered in counterphase.)
The space between the moving elements and the flankers changes over the course of
the trial as the elements move; the flankers were positioned so that they were between

decrease. However, despite these differences, there are commonalities in these data sets. For

predicts that there will be a progressive change in sensitivity to envelope motion as a function of
spacing (or number) and there will be a change in sensitivity to carrier motion based on changes in
the number or elements (or their spacing). Thus, as either spacing or number changes, the
proportion of responses clockwise will progressively change, with the amount of change dependent
on the observer&#8217;s particular sensitivity to envelope and carrier motion and the particular
stimulus parameters. Thus, the model of <a

between spacing and element number. Note that a lack of interaction also implies that
there is not a limited spatial range of summation coming into play; that is, if element
number determines carrier sensitivity, an element far away from the locus of attention
adds as much as an element nearby. If carrier motion were integrated over a spatial
scale within the range tested by this experiment, we would see summation trail off for
stimuli with larger spatial extents, which would have produced an interaction in this
data.

stationary flankers located on either end of the array of objects. The intention behind
including these flankers was to avoid giving away the envelope motion by the motion of
the outermost elements, since effective crowding requires flankers on either side of a
target (<a

motion from becoming uncrowded, they may have induced other side effects, since being
positioned at the ends of the array makes them more salient than the moving elements and
their lack of carrier or envelope motion is likely to have weakened both types of motion
signal.

processing depends on global element number, there is no change in response rate with

local spacing, the change in response rate with element number is not captured (row
C).
<!--l. 445--><p class="indent" >   The two remaining alternatives are carrier global, envelope local (row B) and carrier global,
envelope local (row E). Between these alternatives, carrier global, envelope local appears to fit the
data better. Aggregated across observers, it fits with the highest likelihood out of the four models,
with a log-likelihood ratio of 407 over the next best fit. However, the comparison in likelihoods
does not hold for every observer. Given local envelope motion, global carrier motion gave a better
fit, in terms of likelihood, for 7 out of 8 observers. Results for envelope motion were more
equivocal; given global carrier motion, local envelope motion fit better for 4 out of 8 observers.
However as mentioned earlier, unknown effects of the flankers may be present which would tend to
make strict likelihood comparisons unreliable. Visually comparing the complete set of model
predictions (<a 
href="_masterse8.html#x9-5200126">Figure&#x00A0;8.26</a>) I find that carrier global, envelope local (column E) does the best job at
capturing the directions of effect; models with global envelope motion often have the
wrong direction of effect for changes in element number (see observers JE, MC, ML.)
It is possible that a mixture of local and global effects determines envelope motion
visibility.

href="#x7-290033">Figure&#x00A0;6.3</a>. In summary, as discussed in more detail below, results from Experiment 2 suggest
that the summation of carrier motion is determined over a large spatial scale, large
enough to encompass several targets, while the decline in sensitivity to envelope motion
might be determined within a smaller spatial scale (though this point needs additional
confirmation.)
