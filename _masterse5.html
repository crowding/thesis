spacing.</h3>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >The movies shown in <a 
href="_masterse2.html#x3-20002">Section&#x00A0;2</a> seem to suggest that the perceived change in motion is a function
not only of the properties of individual elements but of a spacing-dependent interaction between
nearby elements. In this experiment I measured hoe the sensitivity to carrier and envelope motion
changed as a function of the distance between elements.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1   </span> <a 
 id="x6-130005.1"></a>Methods</h4>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Stimuli for this experiment consisted of a circle of evenly spaced elements presented at an
eccentricity of <span 
class="cmr-12">6</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">7</span><sup><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x2218;</span></sup>. As described above in <a 
href="_masterse3.html#x4-80003.5">§&#x00A0;3.5</a>, I used an interleaved staircase procedure, with the
staircase varying the speed of the envelope motion. Each staircase used a fixed carrier strength and
spacing. The first training session used four values for spacing and two for carrier strength; I used
data from this session to select values of spacing and carrier strength that were likely to
provide good information about the effects of each variable. Subsequent sessions were
in two types. One focused on the effect of spacing, and tested several spacings at a
single chosen carrier strength. The other focused on the effect of carrier strength, and
tested a fixed set of carrier strengths (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0), at two chosen values of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
spacing. It is possible that observers adapted to the set of stimuli when a single carrier
strength or limited sets of spacings was used for an entire session. However, I found that a
single model fits all types of sessions adequately, so all data is pooled and presented
together.

 id="x6-140005.2"></a>Results</h4>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >I first show individual psychometric functions that illustrate the effects of spacing, carrier
strength and envelope displacement. I found three effects relating envelope motion, carrier
motion, and spacing. I will describe and show these effects qualitatively first, then show
how they are accounted for by the model described in <a 
href="_masterse4.html#x5-110004">Section&#x00A0;4</a> and quantify these
effects.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x6-150005.2.1"></a>Sensitivity to envelope displacement decreases as spacing decreases</h5>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >First consider the effect of reducing spacing (and simultaneously increasing number) on the
perception of envelope motion. There are two potential effects. A reduction in spacing may cause
crowding, while an increased number of identical elements may allow summation or pooling of their
identical envelope motions. These hypotheses would predict opposite effects on the sensitivity to
envelope motion. Pooling would predict that more elements would lead to a greater sensitivity to
envelope motion; crowding would predict that reduced spacing will reduce sensitivity to envelope
motion. I found the latter; an example of this is shown in <a 
href="#x6-150011">Figure&#x00A0;5.1</a>, for a subset of
the data collected. This figure plots the envelope displacement per step, <span 
class="cmr-12">&#x0394;</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span>, on the
horizontal axis and the probability of the observer responding &#8220;clockwise&#8221; to that stimulus
on the vertical axis. For <a 
href="#x6-150011">Figure&#x00A0;5.1</a> data for two values of spacing at the same carrier
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
strength are shown, for three observers. In each case the psychometric function fit to data
collected at the smaller spacing has a shallower slope, independently of any shifts it may
have. Below in <a 
href="#x6-240005.4.3">§&#x00A0;5.4.3</a> I will quantify and graph the relation of sensitivity to element
spacing.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Even if crowding causes interference at smaller spacings, there might still be pooling of envelope
motion between widely spaced elements. Therefore I tested whether there was a change in envelope
motion sensitivity with element number at wider spacings, outside the range of spacings that might
be subject to crowding, but I found no significant effect (<a 
href="#x6-230005.4.2">§&#x00A0;5.4.2</a>). The values of <span 
class="cmr-12">&#x0394;</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x </span>tested are
smaller than half the inter-element spacing of the smallest spacings used, so that spatial aliasing
(the wagon wheel illusion) should not explain why there is additional uncertainty in motion
direction.

 id="x6-160005.2.2"></a>Sensitivity to carrier strength increases as spacing increases; carrier motion is repulsive
in sparse displays</h5>
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >Contrary to the results for envelope motion, the more elements on screen, the more effect carrier
motion had on the appearance. That is, when there were few elements on screen, the effect of
changing carrier motion strength was small; when there were more elements on screen, changes in
carrier motion had more effect on motion appearance (<a 
href="#x6-160012">Figure&#x00A0;5.2</a>). This was complicated by a
repulsive effect; when few elements were used on screen, carrier motion in one direction often
caused observers to shift their reports of perceived motion in the opposite direction. Thus
the response to carrier motion was nonmonotonic; adding elements to a blank display
caused observers to report directions of motion opposite that of the carrier, but adding
more closely-spaced elements caused apparent motion to shift in the direction of carrier
motion. <a 
href="#x6-160012">Figure&#x00A0;5.2</a> gives examples of both these effects, again using a subset of the data
collected. This figure shows data using two different values of carrier strength, each at two
different element spacings. The lower row shows data collected at the wider of the two
spacings.
<!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >   When more elements were added to the display, the sensitivity to carrier motion increased,
indicating summation of carrier motion. The sensitivity to carrier motion corresponds to the
change in responses associated with an increment of carrier strength. <a 
href="#x6-160012">Figure&#x00A0;5.2</a> shows this
measurement for an increment from carrier strength of 0.1 to 0.2, for sparse (5 elements)
and dense (20 elements) displays. The sensitivity to carrier motion corresponds to the
vertical shift in the y-intercept of the psychometric function, illustrated as black arrows in
<a 
href="#x6-160012">Figure&#x00A0;5.2</a>.
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >   Note that sensitivity being discussed is based on the shift in the <span 
class="cmmi-12">y</span>-intercept rather than a shift
in the point of subjective equality (where the psychometric function intercepts <span 
class="cmmi-12">p </span><span 
class="cmr-12">= 0</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">.</span><span 
class="cmr-12">5</span>.) The
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
change in PSE corresponds to the sensitivity divided by the slope of the psychometric function.
Therefore a change in slope without a change in sensitivity would still lead to a change in PSE.
However, since the change in the y-axis intercept changes with spacing, there is an
effect of element number on carrier motion as well as an effect of spacing on envelope
motion. Both effects contribute to the change of appearance seen in <a 
href="_masterse2.html#x3-20002">Section&#x00A0;2</a>. As more
elements are added to the display and packed closer together, the appearance is less
determined by the envelope motion, while it is more determined by the carrier motion. The
combination of both effects mean that carrier motion determines the appearance when the
display is dense and envelope motion determines the appearance when the display is
sparse.

<!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >   Note that when fewer elements are displayed, incrementing carrier motion tends to bias the
appearance in the opposite direction from the carrier motion. In other words carrier motion is
repulsive in sparse displays. In the left column of <a

fitted to this data intercept the vertical axis at values of <span

src="_master6x.png" alt="(clockwise )"  class="left" align="middle"> less than 0.5;
furthermore, increasing the carrier strength from 0.1 to 0.2 increases the repulsion.
So at wide spacings, observers were more likely to perceive a stimulus with stationary
envelopes and clockwise carrier motion as actually moving counterclockwise. When more
elements were added to the display, repulsion turned to assimilation; the same increment to
carrier motion shifted the appearance of the stimulus in agreement with the motion
added.
<!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   This repulsion means that there are some stimuli for which both envelope and carrier motion
are slightly clockwise, but the perceived motion is still counterclockwise; this is the case when the
curves pass through the lower right quadrants in <a

conditions the observer will respond &#8220;counterclockwise&#8221; to a stimulus whose carrier and envelope
motions are both slightly clockwise.
<!--l. 226--><p class="indent" >   <a 
href="#x6-160012">Figure&#x00A0;5.2</a> presents folded data, i.e., values shown here with a single value for carrier strength,
which I nonetheless refer to as &#8220;clockwise,&#8221; represent data collected from both that stimulus and its
mirror image, and envelope motions and responses are mirrored correspondingly. So a point
appearing below <span

&#8220;counterclockwise&#8221; to a particular stimulus more often than they chose &#8220;counterclockwise&#8221; to that
stimulus&#8217;s mirror image. Thus the presentation of folded data here averages out any static biases
toward one direction.
<!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >   In the previous section I illustrated that the sensitivity to envelope motion, visible as the
slope of the psychometric function, decreased when element spacing decreased. In this
section I illustrated that carrier motion has the opposite change in sensitivity; carrier
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
motion has a stronger influence on perceived motion for narrowly spaced stimuli. In this
experiment the spacing between elements covaries with the number of elements, so that it is
indeterminate whether either effect should be considered an effect of the reduced spacing or of
the increased number (this will be explored in <a 
href="_masterse6.html#x7-280006">Section&#x00A0;6</a>. However, in either case, this
contrast identifies a way in which position-defined motion is processed differently from
first-order motion; it appears that envelope motion signals from separate objects are
not pooled in this task, while carrier motion does appear to pool between adjacent
objects.

proportional to the number of trials they summarize. The shade within the circle is a weighted
average of the observer&#8217;s responses, as explained below. Any difference between the shading inside
the circle and that of the background indicates a residual between the model and the

responses, but is based on the difference between the data and model predictions. I based the plot
on the residuals rather than the sample mean for reasons related to the three dimensional
parameter space and the sampling of data throughout that space. First, each circle represents the
subset of trials that lie closest to it in the two dimensions of the plot, but these trials may be
located at any value in the third dimension. For example, in the <span

showing a slice across carrier strength and spacing, data are combined across all speeds
of envelope motion. The response probability varies in the unseen dimension, so that
one circle may combine stimuli for which the observer tends to respond clockwise with
stimuli for which the observer tends to respond counterclockwise. Since I used a staircase
procedure to choose envelope displacement, the the mean response probability in each
bin clusters around 0.5, which would not be useful to display. Since the data are not
uniformly sampled throughout the stimulus configuration space, adjacent bins collect
trials with a different sampling in the unseen dimension, as determined by the staircase
procedure. A simple arithmetic mean of each bin would not lead to a depiction of observed
data that could be visually compared with either adjacent bins or the model on the 2-d
slice.

<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >The four plots in <a 
href="#x6-170024">Figure&#x00A0;5.4</a> illustrate effects associated with carrier strength, envelope motion,
and spacing. The lower left panel shows how the observer&#8217;s response varies for stimuli with no
carrier motion (i.e. with all elements flickering in counterphase.) The horizontal axis measures the
degree of carrier motion used in the stimulus, while the vertical axis measures the inter-element
spacing. When there is no carrier motion, observers tend to report clockwise apparent motion for
envelope motions that are clockwise, and vice versa. This is reflected by the right half of the graph
taking values greater than 0.5 (in red) and the left half of the graph taking values less than 0.5 (in
blue.)
<!--l. 458--><p class="indent" >   The effect captured in the lower left panel is how the sensitivity to envelope displacement
(which corresponds to the inverse of the horizontal distance between contour lines) changes as a
function of spacing. In the model the spacing-dependent sensitivity is described by the function
<span 
class="cmmi-12">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">&#x0394;</span></sub><span 
class="cmr-12">(</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">S</span><span

class="cmmi-12">&#x03B2;</span><sub><span

class="cmmi-12">S</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">C</span></sub>.
The sensitivity to envelope motion decreases at smaller spacing, causing contour lines to spread
apart at the bottom of the graph. The data that is observed, whose residuals are plotted in circles,
shows analogous behavior. Note that at smaller spacings, data has been collected over a wider
range of envelope speeds than at the larger spacings. This is a result of using a staircase
procedure which steps over a wider range when the sensitivity is lower. Even at the smallest
spacings most data has been collected with envelope step sizes significantly smaller than
half the spacing, so that the ambiguity of forming correspondences between element
appearances (i.e. the wagon wheel illusion) should not contribute to the lessening of
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
sensitivity.
<!--l. 478--><p class="indent" >   The upper right panel of <a 
href="#x6-170024">Figure&#x00A0;5.4</a> characterizes responses to envelope and carrier motion at a
wide spacing. Consider starting at the point (0,0), where the response probability is 0.5.
Traveling up the graph, corresponds to adding carrier motion to the stimulus; response
probabilities at first drop below 0.5, exhibiting repulsion. Increasing the carrier motion
further, the repulsion reverses and the observer now reports motion in the direction of
the carrier. At any point, moving horizontally corresponds to a change in the envelope
motion; at the large spacing captured in this graph, sensitivity to envelope motion is
high.
<!--l. 491--><p class="indent" >   The lower right panel has the same axes as the upper right but shows narrow spacings. Moving
vertically in this graph gives a large change in response, reflecting a higher sensitivity to carrier
motion than in the upper right panel. By comparison, moving horizontally shows much less
sensitivity to envelope motion than in the upper right panel. The repulsion effect <span 
class="cmmi-12">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">I</span></sub> that
was evident in the upper graph is swamped by the higher sensitivity to carrier motion
<span 
class="cmmi-12">M</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">S</span></sub>.
<!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the upper left panel shows the combined effects of both the nonlinear repulsion and
spacing-dependent summation effects. Here the envelope motion is fixed to zero. At relatively wide
spacings, moderate carrier strengths induce repulsion, indicated by mostly blue colors on the right
side of the panel. Carrier strengths less than 0.4 generally cause repulsion but as the carrier
strength approaches 1 again, carrier motion once again becomes positive in strength. The
repulsion effect also disappears at narrower spacings. Both the repulsion at weak carrier
strengths and its reversal at at high carrier strengths occurred for most observers in the
dataset.

right panel, the gradient of the decision function is steeper along the axis of envelope motion, and
the model is relatively insensitive to carrier strength. In the lower left graph, showing data at
narrow spacings, the situation has reversed. Broadly speaking it appears that motion is
driven by envelope motion at wider spacings but by the carrier motion when spacing is
narrow.

the repulsion at 0.4 is weaker (see <a

<!--l. 558--><p class="noindent" >This model captures the effect of three factors - carrier strength, envelope motion and
spacing - that each affect apparent motion. The model is phrased in terms of three effects:
summation of carrier motion, crowding of envelope motion, and repulsion driven by carrier
motion strength. This model potentially allows for variation in the appearance of these
stimuli between observers. I have shown that it fits qualitatively, in so far as its fit
appears to capture some of the variation in observed responses. But to justify each
choice made in modeling the data I should try to justify the inclusion of each effect, by
showing that including each effect produces a model that better captures each observers&#8217;
data.
<!--l. 570--><p class="indent" >   There is inter-subject variability; identical stimuli produce different appearances of motion in
different observers. The model I have proposes that this variability is due to different proportions
the same underlying effects. To check this, I will evaluate each effect separately and discuss how
they apply to each observer. One of my goals is to show that despite this variability, the same
qualitative effects appear in each observer; that is, effects should be present in each observer,
though they may vary in proportion.
<!--l. 579--><p class="indent" >   In the following sections I attempt to check the model&#8217;s performance in describing behavior

effects, and by looking at each effect to show that it whether it is consistent across each
observer.

includes an intercept. However the idea of a saturated model does not have a perfect
equivalent in the case of binary responses; since an observer will respond both &#8220;yes&#8221; and
&#8220;no&#8221; to the same stimulus, one cannot capture all the variance, and for cases where the
observer always gives the same answer, this leads to undefined likelihood values. Standard

goodness of fit checks for each effect. Since I sampled a discrete set of spacings and of carrier

<!--l. 640--><p class="noindent" >I motivated the description of the model proposed in <a 
href="_masterse4.html#x5-110004">Section&#x00A0;4</a> by considering that the observer
attends a single element of the display; other elements are not attended, may but exert an
influence via crowding or summation. However, in our task the stimulus is composed of identical,
identically moving elements. Therefore in principle, it is not necessary that an observer isolate
any particular element to measure envelope motion; any element or combination of
elements will do the job. When distinct objects move concurrently, one can perceive
the motion as being of a larger element of which the distinct components are features,
such as in Ternus displays (<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XBoiMarco2009">Boi et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="_masterli1.html#XBoiMarco2009">2009</a>) or as being components of a larger rigid

href="_masterli1.html#XAnstis:2011vn">2011</a>). In the present stimuli, both envelope and carrier motion
are, considered separately, consistent with that of a wheel rotating around the fixation
point. Knowing this, an observer might pool multiple envelope position signals in order
to improve sensitivity to envelope motion. If that is the case, then the sensitivity to
envelope motion (i.e.&#x00A0;the slope of the psychometric function relating envelope motion
to response probability) should increase when additional, coherently-moving elements

 id="x6-260005.4.5"></a>Weak carrier motion repels direction judgments.</h5>
<!--l. 831--><p class="noindent" >Note that the carrier sensitivity measured in the previous section, in addition to the inverse
proportionality to spacing, has a constant generally negative offset. I have referred to this offset as
&#8220;repulsion,&#8221; since negative values of carrier sensitivity means that increments in carrier
strength bias the observer&#8217;s judgements in the opposite direction. Thus, in <a 
href="#x6-250016">Figure&#x00A0;5.6</a>
carrier sensitivity does not approach zero for sparse displays, but some usually negative
value. Carrier motion generally become assimilative when there are more, closely packed
elements in the display. The first is that the strength of repulsion seems to be determined
by the carrier strength of an individual element, rather a sum over nearby elements.
That is, after accounting for summation, which as we saw in <a 
href="#x6-250005.4.4">§&#x00A0;5.4.4</a> can be well fit by
a term proportional to the number of elements, there is a remainder that appears to
be independent of the number of elements or their spacings. This repulsion effect is
independent of element spacing, while the spacing-dependent component of carrier strength
is directly proportional to the number of elements; this might indicate some element
of carrier motion processing that is independent of the number of elements or their
spacing.

<!--l. 857--><p class="noindent" >At carrier strengths approaching 1, the repulsion effect can weaken and even reverse. This effect is
visible in the upper left panel of <a

spacings are repulsive (blue shades) but become assimilative (red shades) as carrier
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
strength is further increased. That corresponds to a situation in which, starting with
a display with no envelope or carrier motion, a little clockwise carrier is added and
the display appears to go counterclockwise, but adding more changes the appearance
to clockwise. The summation effect contributes to this, but is not strong enough for
sparse displays to account for the reversal of apparent motion. There are two notable
characteristics of this repulsion. The first is that the degree of repulsion appears to be a
nonlinear function of direction content. This repulsion is captured in the model in the
function <span

that is a function of the carrier strength but is independent of the element spacing or
number.
