\begin_layout Standard
In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:results-basic"

\end_inset

we saw that the perceived direction of motion is more sensitive to the carrier
 motion when spacing is small but more sensitive to envelope motion when
 spacing is large.
 .
 However, because the stimulus consists of a varying number of elements
 spaced evenly around a circle, the count of elements in the stimulus is
 confounded with the spacing, between elements, one being inversely related
 to the other.
 Therefore in order to confirm that the sensitivity to displacement is a
 function of element spacing rather than number, we should attempt to distinguis
h the two factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, our proposed mechanism of obligatory summation is characterized
 as a function of the product of the carrier direction content with the
 element density (i.e.
 the inverse of the spacing); in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:results-basic"

\end_inset

 this factor has been confounded with the total motion energy in the scene
 (i.e.
 direction content multiplied by number of elements.) To verify that the
 degree of bias depends on spacing rather than total motion energy, we should
 try to distinguish spacing from element number.

Another goal was to determine whether there were differences in performance
 dependent on the location of the elements in the visual field.
 This may give additional clues to the the nature of mechanisms underlying
 the perception of motion direction.
 Depending on which cortical areas are involved in generating a perception
 of motion, we may see more or less interference between moving objects
 For example, the numeric limit on object tracking appears to be independent
 between left and right hemifields

 In contrast, if the reversal shares mechanisms with crowding effects, then
 we might expect a lessened crowding effect for stimuli that span the horizontal

 have shown that when observers attentively track a subset of objects moving
 among distractors, there appears to be a limit to the number of objects
 whose changes in position can be tracked for later identification.
 Adding more elements to our display might then interfere with the ability
 to individuate and track each element, leading to the inability to correctly
 discern their change in position over time.
 Although the number of elements whose global motion can be correctly discerned
 in our display is substantially larger than the limits usually found in
 MOT studies, the elements also move coherently, consistent with a structural
 rotation of the stimulus, which may increase the capacity for tracking

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For similar reasons, element spacing in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:results-basic"

\end_inset

 is also confounded with the aggregate amount of motion energy; reducing
 spacing requires adding more elements, which contributes more motion energy.
 Some motion mechanisms may sum up short-range motion information over large
 regions of the visual field; for example, global optic flow patterns such
 as rotations produce aftereffects in quadrants of the visual field that
 did not contain the adapting stimulus
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Snowden:1997vn"

\end_inset

, suggesting a mechanism tuned to optic flow that integrates large areas
 of the visual field.
 Since the patterns of carrier and envelope motion in our stimulus are (consider
ed separately) consistent with a global rotation, channels sensitive to
 global rotations are likely to contribute to the appearance of our stimuli.
 If these detectors are more sensitive to first-order than than higher order
 motion,

 It does make sense that the optic flow computed in MST is based on a large-scal

 of second-order optic flow; but I don't think the

A third reason concerns the induced motion effect we observed at larger
 element spacings.
 Do these effects depend on element number???
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore we wished to know whether the apparent reversal of the stimulus
 as a function of element spacing could be explained as an effect of the
 number of elements instead.
 Our approach was to show elements covering only a portion of the annulus,
 so that fewer elements were displayed at the same density.

It probably turns out we can't say anything useful on left vs.
 right, because we aren't measuring thresholds.
 Response rates aren't really accurate for quantifying whether there's more
 or less interference.
 Some subjects show differences, but we just explain any differences away
 as a bias.

SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT POINT: It's the slope of the lines that matters most,
 not their height or the change in height with element number (which is
 explained away as full-field sum of motion-energy).
 Whether the lines collapse together plotted against spacing, as PBM, or
 collapse plotted versus number, as NJ, doesn't actually matter.
 What matters is that In particular, it's that the slope does not change
 with element number, that distinguishes this model from e.g.
 one in which element number causes collapse due to failure of attentive
 tracking or whatever.
 Work through why the model predicts this.

Despite apparent differences, the behavior of all subjects exhibits commonalitie

 Each subject's rate of response changes progressively with different values
 of spacing; changing element spacing while holding element number constant

 The converse is also true; changing the number of elements while holding

In the upper plots, the proportion of responses agreeing with long range
 motion is plotted as a function of the number of the element spacing.
 Data is grouped according to the element spacing and separate lines are
 drawn for each spacing.
 In the lower plots, the proportion of responses agreeing with long range
 motion direction is plotted as a function of the number of moving elements,
 with data grouped by the spacing used.

The effects of both element number and element spacing are estimated using
 a logistic regression model.
 Logistic regression coefficients for each subject.
 (stacked bar graph) A multiple logistic regression was used to apportion
 subjects' responses to element count (red bars) or to element spacing.
 Positive values for the density coefficient indicate that the proportion
 of responses agreeing with local motion increased when density increased,
 holding elmeent number constant; vise versa for the count coefficient.
